# Tractatus T1a: Generic `HornModel` constructor (S3 ACT)

Companion to `TractatusOntology.lean` and `TractatusOntologySpectrum.lean`
addressing `tractatus-ontology-oq-06`: the **T1a tier** of the world-model
spectrum (single-hypothesis Horn-clause constrained worlds).

This file generalises the parent file's `ConstrainedWorld S a b`
(a single Horn clause `w a → w b`) to a *list* of Horn clauses, exhibits
`weatherModel` as an instance, and proves the independence-failure
theorem at the generic level. It also states the **exact independence
boundary** `horn_realizable_iff` (TLP 2.061): realizability of every
truth-value assignment holds iff every Horn clause is trivial.

Contents:

- `HornModel S cs` — subtype of `S → Prop` satisfying every Horn
  implication in `cs : List (S × S)`.
- `HornModel.toWorld` — projection to the bare world `S → Prop`.
- `HornModel.toWorldModel` — packaging into a `WorldModel S`.
- `hornModel_equiv_constrainedWorld` — `Equiv` between
  `HornModel S [(a, b)]` and `ConstrainedWorld S a b`.
- `hornModel_independence_fails` — generic Horn-tier independence
  failure: if `cs` is nonempty and every clause has distinct
  head/tail, no Horn-constrained model realises every assignment.
- `horn_realizable_iff` — the exact TLP 2.061 boundary: every truth-value
  assignment is realized by some `HornModel S cs` iff every clause is
  trivial (`c.1 = c.2`). Sharpens `hornModel_independence_fails` to a
  biconditional (see Attribution).
- `weatherModel_equiv_hornModel` — `weatherModel` as a single-clause
  `HornModel` instance, via the equivalence with `ConstrainedWorld`.

## Attribution

Ported from lean-genius (`proofs/Proofs/TractatusOntologyHorn.lean`, the
source of truth for this development) with only the import path adapted to
this repo's flat `proofs/` module convention. The `horn_realizable_iff`
statement was authored by us; its proof was produced by Harmonic's
Aristotle automated theorem prover (https://aristotle.harmonic.fun),
project `1efa3c7d`, 2026-07-12, and is integrated here against the
canonical `HornModel` type (originally staged as a standalone `HornWorld`
in `research/tractatus-ontology/aristotle/batch-2/TractatusHornAristotle.lean`;
the two definitions are structurally identical). Axiom footprint:
`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` only.

No new axioms.  No sorries.

/-- A `HornModel S cs`: world functions satisfying every Horn clause in
    `cs`. Each pair `(a, b) ∈ cs` is read as the implication `w a → w b`.

    This is the **T1a-tier** spectrum representative: a generic
    constructor that recovers `ConstrainedWorld S a b` at
    `cs = [(a, b)]` and admits `weatherModel` as an instance. -/
def HornModel (S : Type) (cs : List (S × S)) : Type :=
  { w : S → Prop // ∀ c ∈ cs, w c.1 → w c.2 }

/-- Project a `HornModel` element to its underlying bare world. -/
def HornModel.toWorld {S : Type} {cs : List (S × S)}
    (hw : HornModel S cs) : World S :=
  hw.val

/-- Package the `HornModel S cs` worlds as a `WorldModel S`. The
    constantly-`False` world satisfies every Horn clause vacuously. -/
def HornModel.toWorldModel (S : Type) (cs : List (S × S)) : WorldModel S where
  W        := HornModel S cs
  holds    := fun hw s => hw.val s
  nonempty := ⟨⟨fun _ => False, fun _ _ h => h.elim⟩⟩

/-- **Single-clause embedding.** A `HornModel S [(a, b)]` is in bijection
    with a `ConstrainedWorld S a b`: both are the subtype
    `{w : S → Prop // w a → w b}`, packaged differently. -/

/-- **Generic Horn-tier independence failure.** If `cs` is nonempty and
    every clause has distinct head and tail, then `HornModel S cs` cannot
    realise every Boolean assignment.

    Generalises `constrained_independence_fails`: the bad assignment
    `s ↦ s = a` (where `(a, b)` is the head clause) cannot be realised,
    because the Horn clause forces `w b` whenever `w a`, contradicting
    `a ≠ b`. -/

/-- **Exact independence boundary (TLP 2.061).** Every truth-value
    assignment `S → Prop` is realized by some `HornModel S cs` iff every
    Horn clause is trivial (`c.1 = c.2`).

    This sharpens `hornModel_independence_fails` from a one-directional
    failure into the exact iff: right-to-left, trivial clauses impose no
    constraint, so the assignment itself is a Horn world; left-to-right,
    a nontrivial clause `(a, b)` (with `a ≠ b`) has no realizer for the
    assignment `fun s => s = a` (its realizer would satisfy `w a`, hence
    `w b`, hence `b = a`).

    Stated in terms of the canonical `HornModel` type; see the file
    Attribution for the Aristotle provenance of the proof. -/

/-- **`weatherModel` as a single-clause `HornModel`.** The weather
    model's worlds (subject to `rain → clouds`) are exactly the
    `HornModel WeatherFacts [(.rain, .clouds)]` worlds.

    This exhibits the parent file's ad-hoc `weatherModel` as an
    instance of the generic T1a-tier constructor — closing the
    S3 PREP §5 hand-off item that the existing instances should be
    expressible through the generic family. -/

/-- The weather Horn-clause has distinct head and tail, so the generic
    independence-failure theorem applies. This recovers
    `weather_independence_fails` at the spectrum level. -/
