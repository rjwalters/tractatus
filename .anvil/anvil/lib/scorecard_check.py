"""Deterministic scorecard arithmetic validation (issue #392).

The cheapest possible pre-flight gate: validate the *emitted* scorecard
against the *stamped* rubric. The existing typed bounds checks
(``review_schema.Score._validate_score_bounds``,
``rubric.Rubric._validate_weight_sum``) only fire on ``_review.json``
payloads and rubric YAML respectively — never on the memo prose triple
(``verdict.md`` + ``scoring.md`` + ``comments.md``) where the canary's
48-weight/44-total scorecard lived undetected for a full revision cycle
(a ``44/44`` verdict whose own ``scoring.md`` weight column summed to 48).

This module fills that gap by composing the existing legacy-adapter
parsers in ``anvil/lib/critics.py`` (``parse_memo_scoring_table``,
``parse_memo_verdict_total``, ``parse_memo_verdict_decision``) with the
per-review rubric stamps (``rubric_id`` / ``rubric_total`` /
``advance_threshold`` in ``_meta.json``, the issue #346 contract
documented in ``anvil/lib/snippets/scorecard_kind.md``).

Checks (finding codes)
----------------------

- ``weights_sum_mismatch`` — the sum of per-dimension weights in the
  scorecard does not equal the **effective pool**, where effective pool
  = stamped ``rubric_total`` + the sum of ``weight_adjustments`` deltas
  when an artifact-type overlay applies (e.g. memo's ``vision-document``
  overlay reduces the pool from 44 to 38). The canary case:
  ``weights_sum_mismatch: 48 != 44``.
- ``score_out_of_bounds`` — a per-dimension score is not a non-negative
  integer ≤ its per-dimension weight.
- ``total_mismatch`` — the declared total (``verdict.md``'s
  ``Total: X/Y``) does not equal the sum of per-dimension scores.
- ``advance_inconsistent`` — ``advance: true`` while the total is below
  the stamped ``advance_threshold`` OR critical flags are present.
- ``pool_unstamped`` — info-level: ``_meta.json`` lacks the #346 stamps
  (legacy pre-#346 review), so there is no pool of record. The other
  checks still run (they are internal to the scorecard); the weights-sum
  check degrades to this info finding.
- ``parse_error`` — the scorecard could not be parsed into a typed
  ``Review`` for a reason other than a per-dimension bounds violation
  (e.g. an empty scoring table). A malformed scorecard must produce
  findings, never an unhandled exception.

Failure behavior (the consumer contract)
-----------------------------------------

- **Write time** (memo-review step 7b, the pilot consumer): findings are
  deterministic arithmetic — the reviewer corrects its own scorecard and
  re-runs the check. If findings persist, ``advance`` is forced false
  via the existing critical-flag pathway (``Scorecard arithmetic
  (lint)`` in ``verdict.md``). A malformed scorecard must never gate the
  state machine to READY.
- **Read time** (``memo-revise`` step 6, ``anvil:rubric-rebackport`` —
  follow-on consumers): the sidecar is immutable; callers record the
  findings and treat the sidecar's verdict as **advisory** — do not
  mutate the sidecar, do not let the malformed verdict drive ADVANCE.

The core check is a **pure function** of ``(Review, stamps)`` — no
filesystem access, mirroring ``critics.aggregate``. The filesystem
convenience ``check_review_dir`` loads via ``critics.load_review``,
reads the stamps from ``_meta.json``, reads any overlay-adjusted pool
from ``_summary.md``'s ``rubric_overlay.weight_adjustments`` block, and
converts ``pydantic.ValidationError`` into findings rather than
crashing.
