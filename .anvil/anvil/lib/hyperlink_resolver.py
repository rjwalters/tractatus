"""Hyperlink resolver critic (issue #335, Epic #328 Track B Phase 2; promoted under #460).

Deterministic link-validation pass that emits a canonical ``_review.json``
(``kind=Kind.TOOL_EVIDENCE``) for broken cross-thread refs, broken markdown
internal paths, broken wiki-links, and (behind ``--check-external``) failing
external HTTP links found in a markdown-bodied version directory
(``<thread>.{N}/<thread>.md`` per the #295 slug-echo convention — the
shape shared by ``anvil:memo`` and ``anvil:essay``).

Track B (mechanical detector) sibling to Track A's reviewer-prose enrichment
(#333 / #334) and Track B Phase 3's citation-coverage critic (#336). The
three pieces are deliberately decoupled — this critic owns hyperlink
resolution only; citation coverage is Phase 3's surface.

Design contract (settled at Epic #328 kickoff; do NOT re-litigate)
------------------------------------------------------------------

- **No schema delta.** Ships with the existing free-form ``Finding.fix``
  / ``Finding.suggested_fix`` text per ``anvil/lib/review_schema.py``.
  No ``action`` / ``target_anchor`` / ``proposed_content`` fields.
- **Promoted under #460.** Born skill-local at
  ``anvil/skills/memo/lib/hyperlink_resolver.py`` (#335) per the
  CLAUDE.md "wait for the second consumer" rule; ``anvil:essay`` (#460)
  is the second consumer (its review wires broken-link resolution as a
  convergence-blocking gate), so the canonical module now lives here at
  ``anvil/lib/hyperlink_resolver.py``. The memo path remains a
  back-compat re-export shim (the #382/#393 promotion pattern).
  ``citation_coverage.py`` deliberately stays memo-local — memo's
  detector finds unlinked load-bearing *claims*; essay's coverage
  concern is unlinked named *entities* (judgment-side,
  corpus-convention-dependent) and is carried as essay-review prose.
- **External HTTP check off by default.** ``check_external=False``
  keeps the critic offline-safe and CI-reproducible; opt in with the
  ``--check-external`` CLI flag or ``check_external=True`` kwarg.
- **Memo + essay.** Pub / report / etc. extensions land in follow-on
  issues when those skills surface the need.

Four link classes
-----------------

1. **Cross-thread refs** — ``[[../<other-slug>/<other-slug>.N]]`` or
   ``[[../<other-slug>/<other-slug>.latest]]``, with optional
   ``/<file>`` suffix. Delegates to
   :mod:`cross_thread_refs.find_cross_thread_refs` +
   :func:`cross_thread_refs.resolve_cross_thread_ref` — **no duplicate
   parsing**. Unresolved refs emit ``severity="blocker"`` findings AND
   raise the :data:`CRITICAL_BROKEN_CROSS_THREAD_ANCHOR` critical flag
   so the reviewer's verdict short-circuits to BLOCKED.
2. **Markdown internal links** — ``[text](path/to/file.md)`` whose path
   resolves relative-to-version-dir (or relative-to-project-root for a
   leading ``/``). Missing target file emits ``severity="major"``.
3. **Markdown external links** — ``[text](https://example.com/...)``.
   When ``check_external=False`` (default), recorded as discovered but
   NOT validated (no finding). When ``check_external=True``, each URL
   is probed via subprocess ``curl -I`` with a short timeout; 4xx / 5xx
   / network failures emit ``severity="major"`` findings; 2xx /
   redirects produce no finding.
4. **Wiki-links** — ``[[document-name]]`` (single-segment, no slash,
   no version specifier — distinct from cross-thread ref shape).
   Validated against the enclosing project's BRIEF.md
   ``documents:`` list when discoverable. Unknown document name emits
   ``severity="major"``.

Inactive-when-empty contract: a memo with no links of a given class
produces zero findings for that class — the critic's output is
byte-equivalent to a clean memo for the unused dimensions.

Public API
----------

``HyperlinkFinding`` — typed per-link result (class, raw text, line,
target, resolved, reason, severity). Sibling to
:class:`render_gate.GateFinding`.

``HyperlinkResolverResult`` — JSON-serializable batch result. Carries
``passed()`` + ``to_json()`` + ``to_review(version_dir, critic_id)``
mirroring :class:`render_gate.GateResult` and
:class:`revise_consistency.ConsistencyResult`.

``resolve_hyperlinks(version_dir, *, check_external=False) ->
HyperlinkResolverResult`` — main entry point. Reads the memo body
(``<slug>.md`` per #295) from ``version_dir``, walks all link
expressions, validates each, returns the batch result.

``write_review_dir(version_dir, result) -> Path`` — writes the
canonical ``<version_dir>.hyperlinks/_review.json`` sibling so
``anvil/lib/critics.py::aggregate`` auto-discovers the findings on
the next reviewer aggregation pass. The output-dir naming convention
(``<thread>.{N}.hyperlinks/``) is the **agreed coordination point**
with the Phase 3 citation-coverage critic (#336), which will write to
``<thread>.{N}.citations/``.

CLI entry-point
---------------

``python -m anvil.lib.hyperlink_resolver <version_dir>
[--check-external] [--write-review]``

Writes a JSON summary to stdout. When ``--write-review`` is set, also
writes ``<version_dir>.hyperlinks/_review.json``. The historical memo
invocation (``python -m anvil.skills.memo.lib.hyperlink_resolver``)
keeps working through the back-compat shim. The CLI entry-point
convention (``python -m <module> <version_dir>``) is documented as the
**agreed coordination point** with the Phase 3 citation-coverage critic
(#336) so both critics share an invocation shape.

Subprocess-only
---------------

External HTTP probing uses ``subprocess.run(["curl", "-I", ...])`` per
the CLAUDE.md "subprocess-only by default" contract. No new Python
deps. When ``curl`` is absent from PATH (rare; ships with macOS and
every modern Linux), each external probe records a graceful-degrade
``reason`` and the link is treated as unverified (NOT a finding).
