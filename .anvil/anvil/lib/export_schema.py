"""Export pydantic schemas as JSON Schema documents.

Run from the repo root:

    python3 -m anvil.lib.export_schema

Two JSON Schema documents are emitted:

- ``anvil/lib/review_schema.json`` — the critic ``_review.json`` payload
  (union of ``Review`` and ``AggregatedReview``).
- ``anvil/lib/rubric_schema.json`` — the rubric YAML shape used by both
  generic convergence-gate rubrics (the skill's declared ``total``,
  ``40`` and ``44`` are the v0 observed shapes) and venue advisory
  overlays (loaded by ``anvil.lib.rubric.load_rubric``).

Both are consumed by non-Python callers (e.g., a future TypeScript
orchestrator) for validation against the same contract as the Python
models.

The review-schema document is the union of two schemas:

- ``$defs.Review`` — the per-critic ``_review.json`` payload.
- ``$defs.AggregatedReview`` — the merged result produced by
  ``anvil/lib/critics.py::aggregate``.

The top-level review schema accepts either shape (``oneOf``) so a single
validator can be pointed at any file in a critic sibling dir.

The rubric-schema document is a single ``Rubric`` shape covering both
generic and advisory venue overlays (discriminated by the ``advisory``
flag inside the document, not by separate top-level schemas).
