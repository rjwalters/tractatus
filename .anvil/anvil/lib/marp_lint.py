"""Static lint pass that mirrors the marp-vscode `slide-content-overflow` diagnostic.

This module is a Python port of the upstream diagnostic introduced in
marp-team/marp-vscode (see https://github.com/marp-team/marp-vscode/issues/519
and the diagnostic file
`src/diagnostics/preview/slide-content-overflow.ts`). The upstream
implementation is **DOM-based**: it inspects the rendered preview's
`section.scrollHeight > section.clientHeight` and
`section.scrollWidth > section.clientWidth`. That cannot run statically in a
markdown pipeline — so this port re-implements the same conceptual rule
("does the slide content exceed the safe area?") as a deterministic capacity
budget over the markdown source.

Upstream port pin
-----------------
- repo:    marp-team/marp-vscode
- file:    src/diagnostics/preview/slide-content-overflow.ts
- sha:     3b8617431867b68f4241c453ae2c7601a4298aa8
- rule(s): slide-content-overflow  (the only diagnostic ported in this seed)

When upstream evolves (additional diagnostics, refined heuristics in the
runtime DOM tracker, etc.), follow-up work should:

1. Re-fetch the upstream file at a newer SHA.
2. Update the SHA pin above.
3. Add new rules to ``_RULES`` below if they map cleanly onto a static check.

Anvil-specific design choices vs. upstream
------------------------------------------
- **Static, not DOM.** Upstream measures the actual rendered slide;
  this port estimates capacity from the markdown source. As a result, the
  Anvil rule is conservative — it catches the obvious overflow patterns
  (the #24 figure + 4 bullets repro and the #25 `_class: ask` H1 + H2 repro
  exhaustively) but defers borderline cases to the VLM critic in issue #30.
- **Severity mapping is stricter.** Upstream emits ``Warning``; in the Anvil
  pipeline the rule is wired as a review-phase hard-fail (per the curator
  addendum on issue #31). The severity returned by ``lint_deck`` is
  ``"error"`` when the capacity overage is clear, ``"warning"`` when borderline,
  and ``"info"`` only as a suppressed result of the
  ``anvil-lint-disable: slide-content-overflow`` escape hatch.
- **Geometry constants** are pulled from
  ``anvil/skills/deck/assets/anvil-deck.css`` and the equivalent slides
  theme: 16:9, 1280×720, padding 56/72, base font 26px, line-height 1.45.
  These constants live at module scope so a consumer with a custom theme can
  override them via the public API (``lint_deck(path, geometry=...)``).
- **Escape hatch.** A per-slide HTML comment of the form
  ``<!-- anvil-lint-disable: slide-content-overflow -->`` suppresses the
  rule for that one slide; the finding is downgraded to ``info`` so the
  reviser still sees that the slide is dense but ``advance`` is not blocked.
- **Aspect- and CSS-aware capacity model (issue #622).** Two refinements
  brought the source-side estimate into agreement with the rendered PDF on
  keyword-less decks (the default drafter output), where the flat charges
  over-fired at ~75%. (1) A keyword-less standalone image whose file is
  locally resolvable relative to the deck is charged its *width-normalized
  rendered height* (read from the PNG's IHDR via stdlib ``struct`` — no new
  dependency), capped at the flat ``image_units`` fallback: a wide-aspect
  mermaid PNG renders far shorter than a square one. (2) A ``<div class="X">``
  whose class is defined ``display:flex`` / ``display:grid`` in the
  frontmatter ``style:`` block has its children re-costed and scaled by
  ``flex_container_cost_factor`` (columns render side-by-side, not stacked).
  Both refinements only *reduce* charges; they add no new error sources.
  Any layout the heuristic still mis-scores keeps the escape hatch above.

Anvil-specific scope
--------------------
- Only the ``slide-content-overflow`` rule is ported from upstream. The
  ``image-resource``, ``frontmatter-deprecated-syntax``, and other
  marp-vscode rules are not ported (they are either irrelevant to Anvil's
  pipeline or out of scope for this iteration).
- The ``figure-italic-supporting-line-too-long`` rule is **Anvil-original**
  (no marp-vscode upstream). It detects a long italic supporting line
  directly under a standalone figure block — the figure-idiom regression
  documented in issues #100 / #101. Authors fold what would have been three
  bullets into one italic sentence; the sentence wraps to 2-3 rendered lines
  and clips at the slide bottom on 16:9 because italic glyph width is ~5%
  wider than upright body weight and the caption margins eat additional
  vertical space. The threshold (18 words OR 108 characters) is anchored
  against the shipped ``clean_figure_plus_supporting_line.md`` fixture and
  the canary regressions from the post-#68 re-render wave (bower.v2 slides
  7/10, citation-clear.v2 slides 7/8, bibliotype.v2 slide 7 — all 25-32
  words). Severity is ``warning`` (the check is a heuristic for *likely*
  overflow; the upstream-derived ``slide-content-overflow`` rule remains
  the authoritative hard-fail capacity check).
- The ``inline-display-style-dropped`` rule is **Anvil-original** (no
  marp-vscode upstream). It detects inline ``style="...display:(grid|flex|
  inline-grid|inline-flex)..."`` attributes in the deck markdown source.
  Marp renders slide content into a ``<foreignObject>`` element inside an
  SVG and rasterizes via Chromium for the canonical ``--pdf`` output;
  through that path, inline ``display:`` rules are silently dropped — the
  slide compiles cleanly but multi-column layouts flatten to single-column
  stacked output (verified by studio's ikebot.3 canary, 2026-05-30; see
  issue #128). The reliable workaround is a frontmatter ``style: |`` block
  defining a CSS class, then ``<div class="...">`` in the slide body —
  class-based selectors apply via the global stylesheet, which the
  foreignObject path does honor. Severity is ``warning`` (the static check
  catches the source pattern but cannot verify the PDF render; the
  ``deck-vision`` VLM critic is authoritative on actual rendered layout).

Public API
----------
``lint_deck(path) -> LintResult``
    Run the lint over a single ``deck.md`` file. Returns errors/warnings/infos
    keyed to slide number and source line.

Promoted to ``anvil/lib/`` per issue #318; both skill-side modules
(``anvil/skills/deck/lib/marp_lint.py`` and
``anvil/skills/slides/lib/marp_lint.py``) are now thin re-exports of this
canonical implementation. The previous ``importlib.util.spec_from_file_location``
shim in the slides skill (the install-order fragility that fired when slides
was installed without deck) is gone — consumers ``from anvil.lib.marp_lint
import …`` directly.

    number of 1.0-unit body lines that fit in the safe area after subtracting
    padding. Every content element below contributes a fractional or integer
    number of line units; the slide overflows when the sum exceeds the budget.

    A "line unit" is calibrated to one body-text line at 26px/1.45 line-height
    plus its tight inter-paragraph spacing — empirically ~40px of vertical
    advance. The budget is the floor of ``(720 - top_pad - bottom_pad) / 40``,
    which lands at 14 line units for the default 56/56 padding. We round down
    by 1 for safety (the budget is 13 in the model below) because horizontal
    word wrap can spill an extra line, and the upstream rule is conservative
    about false-negatives, not false-positives.

    Returns a ``(units, label)`` tuple. The label is a short tag used by the
    cost-breakdown roll-up so a reviser reading the lint message can see WHY
    the cost was charged as it was.

    Marp's image-syntax keywords (https://marpit.marp.app/image-syntax) live
    inside the alt-string between ``![`` and ``](``. The load-bearing
    keywords for the capacity model:

    - ``bg`` (and the panel variants ``bg right:N%`` / ``bg left:N%`` /
      ``bg vertical:N%``) — paints into the slide background. Consumes
      **zero** vertical body-flow units. The image lives behind the body
      content, not inside it.
    - ``h:NNNpx`` / ``h:NN%`` — explicit vertical clamp. We translate the
      pixel/percent height directly to line units using
      ``geo.body_line_height_px`` (px → units) or ``geo.capacity_units``
      (% → units).
    - ``w:NNNpx`` / ``w:NN%`` — explicit width clamp. Only consulted when
      no ``h:`` is present; a width hint <50% is a weak proxy for "small
      image" and downgrades the cost to ``geo.image_small_units``. This is
      the legacy behaviour preserved verbatim.
    - **No keyword** — when the image file is locally resolvable relative to
      ``deck_path`` (issue #622), read its pixel dimensions and charge the
      *width-normalized rendered height* (``height × content_width / width``,
      converted to line units and capped at ``geo.image_units``). A
      wide-aspect PNG (e.g. a 3096×684 mermaid flow chart) renders far
      shorter than the flat full-width assumption, so the flat 7.0u fallback
      over-fired on keyword-less decks. When the path is not resolvable
      (``deck_path=None``, a URL, a missing file, a non-PNG, or a parse
      error) the charge gracefully falls back to ``geo.image_units`` — the
      full-width assumption, unchanged for unannotated standalone-image
      blocks.

    Issue #562 / canary friction: the GoodBoy deck used ``![bg right:55%]``
    hero panels and ``![h:230px]`` clamped figures heavily. The pre-#562
    capacity model charged ``geo.image_units = 7.0u`` for both, blowing the
    13u budget by ~5u on slides that the rendered PDF showed sitting
    comfortably inside the safe area. The reviewer was forced to
    hand-confirm against the PDF on every pass — defeating the
    deterministic gate. Recognising ``bg`` (zero cost) and ``h:`` (true
    vertical cost) brings the source-side estimate into agreement with
    what the renderer actually produces.

    """Detect long italic supporting lines directly under a standalone figure.

    Implements the rule documented in the module docstring's "Anvil-specific
    scope" section. State machine, per slide:

    1. Scan ``slide.body`` lines. Skip blank and directive-comment lines.
    2. **Trigger**: a line matching ``_STANDALONE_FIGURE_RE`` (a single
       ``![alt](path)`` reference that IS the line, modulo whitespace).
    3. **Advance** past blank and directive-comment lines.
    4. **Italic accumulator**: if the next non-blank, non-directive line
       matches ``_FULL_LINE_ITALIC_RE`` (single ``_..._`` or ``*...*``
       spanning the whole stripped line, bold-italic explicitly rejected),
       enter italic-block state. Continue accumulating consecutive italic
       lines (soft-wrap support) until a blank, non-italic, directive, or
       end-of-slide closes the block.
    5. **Measure**: word count = ``len(inner.split())``; char count =
       ``len(inner)`` of the inner text with the italic delimiters stripped
       (delimiters don't render and shouldn't be counted).
    6. **Flag** if ``words > geo.italic_supporting_line_max_words`` OR
       ``chars > geo.italic_supporting_line_max_chars``. Emit a ``warning``
       with ``rule="figure-italic-supporting-line-too-long"`` (downgraded
       to ``info`` if the per-slide ``anvil-lint-disable`` directive is set
       for this rule).
    7. After any close (flagged or not), continue scanning for the next
       figure trigger within the same slide. A slide with two figures gets
       two independent checks.
