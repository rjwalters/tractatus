"""Rendering helpers shared by Anvil vision critics.

This module is the "render-the-artifact-to-pixels" primitive consumed by
``anvil/lib/vision.py`` and per-skill vision critics. It wraps four
external tools as subprocess shell-outs:

- ``marp`` (the Marp CLI) for Markdown deck/slides → PDF.
- ``pdftoppm`` (poppler-utils) for PDF → per-page PNGs. This is the
  primary path; ``pdf2image`` (Python wrapper around the same library) is
  a documented fallback for environments where ``pdftoppm`` is not on
  PATH but the Python wheel is installed.
- ``pandoc`` for prose Markdown (pub/report) → PDF.
- Nothing — for ``render_matplotlib_figures`` which just enumerates an
  already-rendered ``figures/`` directory.

Design notes
------------

1. **Subprocess-only.** No native Python bindings (no PyMuPDF, no
   poppler-python). Skills get a consistent installation story: install
   the system binaries, not a parallel set of Python wheels.
2. **No re-execution of figure generators.** The matplotlib walker
   enumerates PNGs that the skill's ``figures`` command has already
   produced; vision is a critic, not a producer.
3. **Marp config pin.** ``render_marp_to_pdf`` always invokes
   ``marp --config-file anvil/lib/marp/config.yml`` (per #32) so the
   rendered PDF matches what the user actually sees in production.
4. **Domain exceptions.** Each renderer raises ``RenderError`` with the
   captured stderr on non-zero exit so callers can surface the failure
   uniformly. ``RenderError`` is also raised when a required binary is
   missing — the caller should not have to grep ``FileNotFoundError``
   tracebacks.

pdftoppm vs pdf2image
---------------------

The default path uses ``pdftoppm`` directly. It's the upstream tool
shipped by poppler-utils and is already documented as a ``deck-design``
dependency. Output filenames follow pdftoppm's convention: passing
``page`` as the output basename produces ``page-1.png``, ``page-2.png``,
etc. (one-indexed, no zero-padding). ``render_pdf_to_pngs`` re-walks
the directory and returns the sorted list.

The ``pdf2image`` Python wrapper (https://pypi.org/project/pdf2image/)
calls ``pdftoppm`` under the hood. It is documented here as a fallback
for environments where the Python wheel is preferred over a system
package install, but is not used by default — ``pdftoppm`` directly
keeps the dependency set minimal.

If neither is available, ``render_pdf_to_pngs`` raises ``RenderError``
with a message naming both options.

    """Render a Mermaid ``.mmd`` source to a PNG via the ``mmdc`` CLI.

    This is the canonical wrapper consumed by ``deck-figures`` and
    ``slides-figures`` (issue #545). The two skills previously documented
    identical inline ``mmdc`` invocations; promoting the shared call into one
    Python helper gives a single place to evolve the flag set (mirrors the
    "lib promotion after second consumer" pattern documented in
    ``CLAUDE.md``).

    The default flag set:

    - ``--width 1600 --height 900`` — viewport the diagram renders INTO
      (NOT the output canvas — mmdc crops the PNG to the diagram's intrinsic
      bounding box after rendering, so small-node-count ``flowchart LR``
      grammars still produce wide-thin output regardless of this value).
    - ``--scale 2`` — multiplies the rendered SVG dimensions by 2 before PNG
      conversion. This is the load-bearing knob for legibility on the
      default deck theme: it doubles pixel density so a 784×102 thin strip
      becomes 1568×204, which is legible at the theme's ``max-height`` cap.
      Without ``--scale``, the documented invocation produces unusable PNGs
      for sparse flowchart grammars (the goodboy canary signal that drove
      issue #545).
    - ``--backgroundColor white`` — opaque white background by default; pass
      ``transparent`` to overlay on theme-colored slide backgrounds.
    - ``-c anvil/lib/figures/mermaid-theme.json`` — the shared navy-on-grey
      Anvil mermaid theme. Pass ``config=None`` to use this default, or an
      explicit path to override (consumers who ship their own theme).

    Orientation guidance (NOT enforced by this function): for cyclic
    flowcharts (e.g., a 3-node feedback loop), prefer ``flowchart TB`` over
    ``flowchart LR`` in the ``.mmd`` source. ``LR`` with a small node count
    crops to a wide-thin strip that ``--scale 2`` legibilizes but does not
    re-orient. The figurer commands document this convention; this wrapper
    does NOT auto-rewrite (an orientation auto-detect is a tracked follow-up).

    Parameters
    ----------
    src_mmd:
        Path to the input ``.mmd`` (Mermaid grammar) source.
    out_png:
        Output PNG path. Parent directory must exist (the figurer typically
        creates ``figures/`` ahead of calling).
    width, height:
        Viewport dimensions in pixels. Defaults to ``1600x900``. Note: this
        is the render viewport, not the output canvas — see the ``--scale``
        note above for the legibility knob.
    scale:
        Multiplier applied to the rendered SVG before PNG conversion. The
        default ``2`` is the issue-#545 fix: it doubles pixel density so
        sparse flowchart grammars produce legible PNGs at the deck theme's
        ``max-height`` cap.
    background_color:
        Mermaid ``--backgroundColor`` value. ``"white"`` (default),
        ``"transparent"``, or a hex color.
    config:
        Optional override for the mermaid theme config (``-c <file>``).
        Defaults to :data:`DEFAULT_MERMAID_THEME` when ``None``.

    Returns
    -------
    The output PNG path (the same as ``out_png``), for caller chaining.

def check_weasyprint_available() -> bool:
    """Return ``True`` if ``weasyprint`` is on PATH AND passes a runtime smoke test.

    The smoke test runs ``weasyprint --version`` and treats a non-zero exit as
    unavailable. This catches cases where the binary is on PATH but runtime
    deps (libgobject-2.0-0 / cairo / pango) are missing — which causes exit 43
    at render time without a useful error message.

    Two-stage check:
    1. ``shutil.which`` — fast binary-presence test (existing pattern)
    2. ``subprocess.run(["weasyprint", "--version"])`` — runtime viability check

    A ``TimeoutExpired`` (5 s) or ``OSError`` on the smoke test returns ``False``
    rather than raising, matching the graceful-degrade contract of this family.

    ``weasyprint`` is the PREFERRED HTML-to-PDF engine for the anvil:memo
    render chain (see ``anvil/lib/memo/README.md``). It supports the full CSS
    paged-media spec used in ``anvil/lib/memo/styles.css`` (the ``@page``
    rule with ``counter(page) / counter(pages)`` page numbering) without
    CLI-flag translation.

    Subprocess-only by design: the framework intentionally calls weasyprint
    as a CLI binary (``weasyprint input.html output.pdf``) rather than
    importing it as a Python module. This keeps the install story uniform
    across engines (HTML chain = one binary per engine) and matches the
    rest of ``render.py`` (no Python wheels in the dependency surface).

    See also :data:`MEMO_RENDERER_REMEDIATION` for the install story callers

    ``wkhtmltopdf`` is the FALLBACK HTML-to-PDF engine for the anvil:memo

    binary with no Python dependency, useful in environments where the
    weasyprint native deps (cairo, pango) are unavailable but a single-binary
    install is acceptable.

    NOTE: wkhtmltopdf's paged-media support is a partial subset of CSS3
    paged-media. Some of the ``@page`` rules in ``anvil/lib/memo/styles.css``
    (notably the ``@bottom-center { content: counter(page) ... }`` page
    footer) are not honored by wkhtmltopdf and must be passed via its
    ``--footer-center`` / ``--header-*`` CLI flags instead. Phase 3's
    memo-render command will own that translation. This availability check
    does NOT distinguish the two paths — it only confirms the binary is on
    PATH; the engine-selection logic decides which translation to apply.
