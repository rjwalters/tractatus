"""Figure-content VLM critic (Epic #328 Phase 4, issue #340).

This module ships the **figure-content** VLM critic — a vision-language-model
pass that scores every figure in a memo or report version directory along
three axes:

1. **On-brand match** against ``anvil/lib/figures/palette.py`` (does the
   figure use the Anvil navy / muted-grey ramp, or has it slipped into
   matplotlib default tab10 / a non-brand accent?).
2. **Caption-claim grounding** (does the caption accurately describe what
   the figure visually depicts?).
3. **Adjacency-claim grounding** (does the figure support the surrounding
   prose claim, or is it a non-sequitur next to the text that introduces
   it?).

Direct-lib placement (NOT skill-local)
--------------------------------------

This critic ships at ``anvil/lib/figure_content.py`` (not under
``anvil/skills/memo/lib/`` like the Phase 2 ``hyperlink_resolver`` precedent)
because two consumers — the ``memo`` skill and the ``report`` skill — both
have figure-evidence dimensions today and reach for this primitive
simultaneously. The CLAUDE.md ``Skill-local first, lib promotion later``
rule explicitly carves out the two-consumer threshold: the rule is "wait
for the *second* consumer before generalizing", which is satisfied at ship.

Design contract (settled at Epic #328 reactivation; do NOT re-litigate)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- **No schema delta.** Every emitted ``Finding`` uses the existing free-form
  ``Finding.suggested_fix`` text. No ``action`` / ``target_anchor`` /
  ``proposed_content`` fields. Matches the Phase 2 (hyperlink-resolver,
  #335 / PR #338) and Phase 3 (citation-coverage, #336 / PR #337) settle.
- **VLM cost cap.** Per-figure budget enforced at module level. The default
  is **one** VLM call per figure per run; pass ``vlm_budget_per_figure=N``
  to ``critique_version_dir`` to tune.
- **Content-hash cache.** A session-lifetime in-process cache keyed by the
  SHA-256 of the figure bytes prevents the same image from being VLM-passed
  twice within a single run. The cache is intentionally **internal** to
  this module; promotion to ``anvil/lib/vision_cache.py`` is a follow-on
  if Phase 5 (``image-accessibility``, #341) reaches for the same shape.
- **Critical flag.** ``critical_figure_misrepresents_claim`` fires when
  the VLM detects a caption-vs-figure contradiction (e.g. caption says
  "revenue tripled in Q3" but the figure shows a flat line). The aggregator's
  ``compute_verdict`` short-circuits to ``Verdict.BLOCK`` per the issue
  #340 AC.
- **Subprocess-only for figure extraction.** PDF-to-PNG uses ``pdftoppm``
  (poppler-utils) via ``anvil.lib.render.render_pdf_to_pngs``. When
  ``pdftoppm`` is not on PATH the critic graceful-degrades: it emits a
  top-level ``reason`` and zero findings (no false-positive findings on a
  pipeline missing the tool).

Two figure discovery paths
--------------------------

1. **Rendered PDF**: when ``<version_dir>/<slug>.pdf`` (memo / report
   convention) exists, each page is extracted as a PNG via ``pdftoppm``
   into a temporary directory and treated as one figure.
2. **Direct sources**: ``<version_dir>/figures/`` (any depth) is walked for
   ``.png`` / ``.jpg`` / ``.jpeg`` / ``.svg`` files. SVG files are skipped
   (the VLM consumes raster images; an SVG figure is recorded as
   "unverified" via a top-level reason rather than a finding so the operator
   sees the gap without a false positive).

The two paths are **complementary**: a memo that has both a draft PDF and
a ``figures/`` source dir gets both surfaces critiqued. The hash cache
deduplicates if the rendered page and the source PNG share bytes (rare
in practice — pdftoppm rasterizes at a fixed DPI; the source PNG was
typically authored at a different one).

CLI entry-point
---------------

::

    python -m anvil.lib.figure_content <version_dir> [--write-review]

Exit codes mirror the Phase 2 / Phase 3 precedents:

- ``0``: clean pass (no findings, no critical flag).
- ``1``: one or more findings (or a critical flag).
- ``2``: invocation error (missing ``version_dir``).

Coordination with sibling deferred phases
-----------------------------------------

#341 (``image-accessibility``) also touches VLM and may benefit from the
content-hash cache. The cache is shipped **inline** here per the issue
body's coordination note; promotion to a shared ``anvil/lib/vision_cache.py``
is deferred until #341's builder reaches for the same shape.

#342 (``claim-figure-grounding``) shares figure-discovery logic (walking
``figures/`` and the PDF). Same deferral: ship inline; promote later if
duplication is observed.

All three deferred-phase critics share the CLI shape
``python -m <module> <version_dir> [--write-review]`` and the
``<version_dir>.<tag>/`` sibling-dir convention so the
``anvil/lib/critics.py::discover_critics`` auto-discovery contract picks
up the result without aggregator changes.

    The cache is intentionally simple — a dict that lives for the lifetime
    of one ``critique_version_dir`` call (or longer if the caller hands the
    same cache instance into multiple calls). Eviction policy:
    **session-lifetime, no eviction within a session**. The caller controls
    cache lifetime by instantiating a fresh ``FigureVLMCache`` per session.

    The cached value is the raw VLM payload dict (the same shape
    :class:`VisionCritic.critique`'s callback receives), NOT a
    :class:`Review`. The Review is constructed per-figure with figure-
    specific context (label, version_dir, evidence_span) so the cache is
    payload-level not Review-level.

    Promotion path: when Phase 5 (``image-accessibility``, #341) reaches for
    this primitive, move it to ``anvil/lib/vision_cache.py`` and have both
    critics share. Until then it ships inline here per the coordination note
    in the #340 issue body.

    extraction + ``figures/`` dir walk), runs a VLM pass per unique
    content hash (with cache hit on repeat), and assembles a
    :class:`FigureContentResult` for downstream aggregation / persistence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    version_dir
        Path to ``<thread>.{N}/``. The PDF is discovered as
        ``<thread>.pdf`` (slug-echo per #295) or any single ``*.pdf`` in
        the directory. ``figures/`` is walked recursively.
    callback
        Optional ``VisionCallback`` for offline / test use. When ``None``,
        the default :class:`VisionCritic` path tries the Anthropic SDK
        (which requires ``anthropic`` + ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``). Tests
        ALWAYS pass a stub callback.
    model
        Anthropic model id surfaced on ``Review.model``. Defaults to the
        :class:`VisionCritic` default.
    cache
        Session-lifetime VLM payload cache. When ``None``, a fresh
        :class:`FigureVLMCache` is created and used for this call only.
    vlm_budget_per_figure
        Max VLM calls per unique figure (default ``1`` per the issue
        body). Repeat content hashes hit the cache regardless.
    figure_captions
        Optional ``{label: caption}`` map so the prompt can carry the
        caption text for the ``caption_grounding`` axis. The label is the
        :attr:`FigureRecord.label` value.
    figure_adjacency
        Optional ``{label: adjacent prose}`` map for the
        ``adjacency_grounding`` axis.
    pdf_dpi
        Rasterization DPI for PDF page extraction (default 150 — the
        :func:`render_pdf_to_pngs` default).
    extract_dir
        Optional caller-provided tempdir for extracted PNGs. When
        ``None``, a tempdir is created and not cleaned up — extracted PNGs
        survive the call so the caller can use the paths surfaced on
        :attr:`FigureRecord.path` for follow-on actions.

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`FigureContentResult` carrying per-figure scores + findings +
    critical flags + top-level reasons + VLM call / cache-hit counters.

    Raises
    ------
