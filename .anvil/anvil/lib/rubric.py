"""Typed schema and loader for Anvil rubric YAML files.

This module is the machine-readable canonicalization of the rubric shape
documented in ``anvil/lib/snippets/rubric.md``. It is sibling to
``review_schema.py`` (the on-disk shape of critic outputs) and
``critics.py`` (discovery + aggregation): rubrics define the dimension
list and weights that scores are taken against.

Two kinds of rubric coexist in the ecosystem:

1. **Generic convergence-gate rubrics** — every skill ships one as a
   markdown file (``anvil/skills/<skill>/rubric.md``). These define the
   dimensions whose weighted sum drives the
   ``advance = (total >= threshold) AND (no critical flag)`` decision.
   The v0 shipped skills declare either ``total: 40`` (8 dimensions)
   or ``total: 44`` (9 dimensions); the lib is total-agnostic and
   accepts any positive integer. The per-skill shape requirements are
   documented in ``snippets/rubric.md`` §"Shape requirements".
2. **Advisory venue-pinned overlays** — venue YAMLs (e.g. ``neurips.yaml``,
   ``nature.yaml``, ``arxiv.yaml``) under
   ``anvil/skills/pub/rubrics/``. These produce supplementary scoring
   that the reviser consumes for venue-specific signal, but do NOT
   contribute to the convergence-gate decision. Their weights need not
   sum to the declared ``total``, and ``threshold`` may be omitted.

Both kinds use the same ``Rubric`` pydantic model. The discriminator is
the ``advisory`` flag:

- ``advisory: false`` (default) — sum-of-weights MUST equal ``total``.
- ``advisory: true`` — sum-of-weights NEED NOT equal ``total``; the
  loader accepts the mismatch and the convergence gate ignores the rubric.

This split lets venue overlays declare any sensible total (NeurIPS /16,
Nature /15, arXiv /10) without breaking the per-skill gate-rubric
invariant that the skill's declared ``total`` means the same thing
across versions of that skill's reviewer.

Discovery
---------

Venue rubrics are looked up via ``discover_venue_rubric`` with a
three-tier search order documented inline. The per-thread tier lets a
single thread use a non-shipped venue without modifying the consumer
install; the consumer-installed tier lets a consumer ship a custom
venue across all their threads; the skill-shipped tier provides the
defaults.
