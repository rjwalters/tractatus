"""Per-company theme primitive (issue #322 — Phase A).

A *theme* is a named bundle of brand-level defaults that anvil skills
resolve below the per-thread BRIEF.md override surface. The motivating
canary need (issue #322) is the studio's portfolio split — one tenant
running multiple brands through the same anvil pipeline — but the
primitive is generic.

Lookup precedence (per the issue body's design)::

    per-thread BRIEF.md document entry
        >  project-level BRIEF.md (theme: <name>)
        >  per-theme theme.yml
        >  framework default

This module owns the **theme.yml loader** — the small typed reader that
turns ``<consumer>/.anvil/themes/<theme>/theme.yml`` into a typed
:class:`Theme`. Per-skill *asset resolvers* (template + stylesheet
precedence walkers) live under each skill's ``lib/`` directory; see
``anvil/skills/memo/lib/theme_resolver.py`` for the Phase A memo
implementation.

Phase A scope
-------------
- Pydantic :class:`Theme` model (open-set per-skill knob blocks via
  ``extra="allow"``).
- :func:`load_theme` reader — returns ``None`` cleanly when the theme
  directory or theme.yml is absent (so consumers without themes are
  unaffected).
- :func:`find_consumer_root` walks upward from a path looking for the
  ``.anvil/`` marker directory (the installed-anvil sentinel — the
  install script writes ``<consumer>/.anvil/anvil/...`` per the post-#230
  layout).

Phase B (deferred to per-skill follow-up issues) lifts the resolver to
``anvil:proposal``, ``anvil:installation``, ``anvil:deck``,
``anvil:slides``, ``anvil:report``, ``anvil:pub``, ``anvil:ip-uspto``.

class Theme(BaseModel):
    """Typed representation of a ``<consumer>/.anvil/themes/<name>/theme.yml``.

    The fields enumerated here are the **framework-level** knobs that
    multiple skills consume (accent color, studio name, fonts, render
    engine). Per-skill nested blocks (``memo:``, ``proposal:``,
    ``installation:``, ``deck:``, ``slides:``, ``report:``, ``pub:``,
    ``ip-uspto:``) ride under ``extra="allow"`` — Phase A does not
    enumerate them. Each Phase B follow-up issue will add a typed reader
    for the specific skill's nested block (e.g., adding
    ``proposal.signature_color`` as a typed field once
    ``anvil:proposal`` wires the resolver).

    The theme.yml schema is intentionally **forgiving** about unknown
    fields: themes are consumer-defined and may carry knobs that future
    framework versions formalize. The :func:`load_theme` reader prefers
    "skip silently" over "raise" for unknown keys so the consumer's
    theme.yml isn't a versioning hostage.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name
        The theme's directory basename (e.g. ``"sphere-semi"``). Filled
        in by :func:`load_theme`; not a YAML key the consumer writes.
    accent_color
        Cross-skill brand accent (LaTeX, CSS, Marp themes all consume
        this). Free string — typically ``#RRGGBB`` but no validation is
        enforced (some skills want named colors).
    studio
        Studio / company name for cover-page templates, footers, etc.
    body_font
        Body-text font family the renderer should pin. Skills decide
        how to consume it (LaTeX ``\\setmainfont``, CSS
        ``font-family``).
    mono_font
        Monospace font family for code blocks, tables, etc.
    render_engine
        For skills with multiple renderer chains (currently just
        ``anvil:memo``), the brand's preferred engine. Subject to
        availability — if the engine is not on PATH, the skill falls
        back to its existing selection logic. Recognized values
        currently track ``MEMO_ENGINE_WEASYPRINT`` /
        ``MEMO_ENGINE_WKHTMLTOPDF`` / ``MEMO_ENGINE_XELATEX`` for the
        memo skill; future skills define their own enums.
    raw
        The full parsed YAML dict, including any per-skill nested
        blocks the consumer wrote. Phase B readers extract per-skill
        knobs from here until typed fields are added.

def find_consumer_root(start: Path) -> Optional[Path]:
    """Walk upward from ``start`` and return the consumer repo root.

    The "consumer root" is the directory containing the ``.anvil/``
    marker — the directory written by ``scripts/install-anvil.sh`` to
    seat the installed framework. This is the same root the theme
    catalog lives under (``<root>/.anvil/themes/<name>/``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    start
        Any path (file or directory; existent or not). The walk uses
        ``Path`` arithmetic and only consults the filesystem at each
        candidate directory.

    Returns
    -------
    Optional[Path]
        The consumer root, or ``None`` when no enclosing directory has
        a ``.anvil/`` sibling. Tests running from a temp directory
        without an installed anvil get ``None`` and the resolver falls
        through to framework defaults.

    Notes
    -----
    The walk **does not** require that ``.anvil/themes/`` exists — only
    that ``.anvil/`` exists. A consumer who has installed anvil but
    declared no themes still produces a valid consumer root (the theme
    loader returns ``None`` for any specific theme name).

def load_theme(

    """Load ``<consumer_root>/.anvil/themes/<theme_name>/theme.yml``.

    Absence-tolerant by design: returns ``None`` rather than raising
    when the consumer root, theme directory, or theme.yml is missing.
    Callers (asset resolvers) treat a ``None`` return as "no theme tier
    applies, fall through to the next precedence level".

    Parameters
    ----------
    consumer_root
        The consumer repo root (the directory containing ``.anvil/``).
        When ``None``, the function short-circuits and returns ``None``
        — caller did not locate a consumer root and there's no theme
        catalog to consult.
    theme_name
        The theme's directory basename, as declared by the project
        BRIEF's ``theme:`` field. When ``None`` or empty, the function
        returns ``None`` — no theme was declared.

    Returns
    -------
    Optional[Theme]
        Parsed theme, or ``None`` when any of:

        - ``consumer_root`` is ``None``.
        - ``theme_name`` is ``None`` or empty.
        - ``<consumer_root>/.anvil/themes/<theme_name>/`` does not
          exist or is not a directory.
        - ``<consumer_root>/.anvil/themes/<theme_name>/theme.yml`` does
          not exist (a theme dir may be a typography-only override
          tier with no metadata — that's valid; just no Theme model).
        - The theme.yml file is unreadable or has unparseable YAML.

    Raises
    ------
    This function never raises. Misconfiguration in theme.yml (e.g. a
    non-dict top-level value) returns ``None`` — the consumer's render
    falls through to the next tier. This matches the broader anvil
    pattern of graceful degrade for opt-in overrides.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> theme = load_theme(Path("/repo"), "sphere-semi")
    >>> theme.accent_color
    '#0066CC'
    >>> theme.skill_block("memo").get("signature_color")
