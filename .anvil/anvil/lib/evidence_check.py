"""Quoted-evidence verifier for critic scoring tables (issue #464).

Fifth member of the deterministic-checks family (alongside
``anvil/lib/render_gate.py``, ``anvil/lib/marp_lint.py``,
``anvil/lib/revise_consistency.py``, ``anvil/lib/scorecard_check.py``,
and ``anvil/lib/numeric_consistency.py``). It enforces the
**quoted-evidence discipline** from the draftwell survey: every
per-dimension score in a critic's ``scoring.md`` must cite verbatim
text from the document under review, so a lazy critic cannot emit
plausible-sounding scores ungrounded in the actual draft (the same
failure class the studio canary hit with VLM critics scoring figures
they had not decoded).

The snippet-side contract lives in ``anvil/lib/snippets/rubric.md``
§"Dimension scoring guidance" rule 1: each dimension's justification
embeds at least one verbatim quote from the reviewed body — wrapped in
double quotes, followed by a human-facing location anchor — and a dim
scored at full weight MAY substitute the by-absence marker phrase
``no instance of <X> found`` (absence of defects has no quotable span).
This module is the deterministic verifier for the quote half of that
rule; anchors are judgment-scope and are NOT validated here.

Deterministic subset (pure stdlib — no LLM, no new deps)
--------------------------------------------------------

1. **Scorecard parsing** — two scorecard shapes feed the SAME
   classifier:

   - **Table (``human-verdict``)** — reuses
     ``anvil/lib/critics.py::parse_memo_scoring_table`` on the
     ``| # | Dimension | Weight | Score | Justification |`` row shape.
   - **Machine-summary (``machine-summary``)** — the two ip skills
     (``ip-uspto``, ``ip-uspto-provisional``) write a *partial* scorecard
     inside ``_summary.md``. The canonical shape the commands instruct
     and the examples carry is the SAME markdown table
     (``| # | Dimension | Weight | Score | Justification |``), so the
     machine-summary path reuses ``parse_memo_scoring_table`` too (issue
     #536). A fenced ``json`` ``dimensions`` block (issue #496) is also
     accepted when present — :func:`parse_machine_summary_dimensions`
     parses each dimension key to ``null`` (un-owned) or an object with
     ``score`` + ``justification`` (+ optional ``weight``) — but no
     shipped command doc or example emits it, so it is forward-compat /
     legacy and the table fallback fires in practice. The classifier,
     normalization, span+elision matching, and the by-absence marker are
     all scorecard-source-agnostic — only the parser differs, and the
     machine-summary route tries JSON first then the table.

   Rows with a ``null`` / ``n/a`` / ``-`` score are skipped entirely:
   a critic that does not own a dimension (the partial-scorecard rule
   in ``snippets/critics.md``) owes no evidence for it. Dispatch is by
   the sibling ``_meta.json`` ``scorecard_kind`` discriminator (NOT a
   hardcoded skill name) so the routing generalizes to any future
   machine-summary skill.

2. **Quoted-span extraction** — text inside straight (``"…"``) or
   curly (``“…”``) double quotes within the justification cell.
   Spans shorter than :data:`MIN_QUOTE_CHARS` characters (after
   normalization) are ignored — trivial / idiomatic quoting ("why
   now", "soft target") is not evidence. The cutoff is a heuristic
   module constant, tuned on canary signal.

3. **Matching** — both the span and the body are normalized (curly →
   straight quotes, em/en dashes and ``--`` / ``---`` hyphen runs
   folded to one canonical dash token, markdown emphasis characters
   ``*`` / ``_`` / backticks stripped, whitespace collapsed) and the
   span must appear as a **case-sensitive substring** of the
   normalized body. LaTeX bodies (``main.tex``) are matched against
   the ``.tex`` source verbatim — reviewers read source, so quotes
   must match source (the symmetric dash fold keeps ``--`` / ``---``
   dash markup in ``.tex`` source self-consistent with quotes typed
   either way).

   **Ellipsis elision** (issue #478) is permitted *inside a span*:
   a span containing ``...`` / ``…`` is split on the elision markers
   and matches when every fragment (each ≥ :data:`MIN_QUOTE_CHARS`
   normalized chars — the per-fragment floor that blocks
   ``"the ... market"``-style trivial stitching) appears verbatim in
   the body **in document order** (advancing-cursor match: fragment N
   must start after fragment N−1 ends) **and** all fragments fall
   within :data:`ELISION_WINDOW_CHARS` normalized characters of the
   first fragment's match start (the anti-stitching proximity window —
   two distant real fragments must not stitch into fabricated
   meaning). Fragment matching is greedy-leftmost (each fragment binds
   to its first in-order occurrence; no backtracking retry — a
   documented v1 simplification). A span that matches the body as a
   plain substring (e.g. it quotes a *literal* ellipsis present in the
   body) passes without fragment splitting; leading/trailing ellipses
   degrade to plain single-fragment matching. Elision handling lives
   in :func:`span_matches_body`, NOT in :func:`normalize` — folding
   ellipses in the normalizer would corrupt body text containing
   literal ellipses.

4. **Per-justification classification** (this ordering is
   load-bearing — it tolerates calibration-suffix quotes from
   ``rubric_overrides`` / artifact-type overlays that legitimately
   quote rubric prose, not body text):

   1. ≥1 extracted span matches the body → **pass**.
   2. ``score == weight`` AND the by-absence marker
      (``no instance of <X> found``) is present → **pass**
      (ceiling-by-absence contract).
   3. ≥1 span extracted but NONE matches the body →
      **major finding**: :data:`FABRICATED_EVIDENCE` — the quote does
      not appear verbatim in the reviewed body.
   4. No spans at all → **minor (advisory) finding**:
      :data:`MISSING_EVIDENCE`.

Where findings flow (issue #464 curation)
-----------------------------------------

**No sidecar is written.** Two consumption modes only:

1. **Write-time self-check** (the memo pilot): the reviewer runs this
   verifier against its staging-dir ``scoring.md`` (via ``--scoring``)
   alongside the existing ``scorecard_check`` invocation. Missing-
   evidence findings → the reviewer adds the quote before the sidecar
   lands; fabricated-evidence findings → hard self-check failure: the
   reviewer re-derives the justification from the actual body. Same
   deterministic-correction posture as the scorecard arithmetic gate.
2. **Standalone post-hoc CLI** over legacy review dirs → advisory
   reporting only — never mutates, never gates.

A ``--write-review`` critic-sibling mode (a critic reviewing critics)
is explicitly OUT of scope — the aggregator is untouched.

CLI entry-point
---------------

``python -m anvil.lib.evidence_check <version_dir> [--scoring <path>]
[--body <path>]``

Without ``--scoring``, discovers every critic-sibling
``<version_dir>.<critic>/scoring.md`` (table) and
``<version_dir>.<critic>/_summary.md`` (machine-summary JSON — issue
#496) next to the version dir (the critic-sibling glob per
``snippets/critics.md``), routing each by its sibling ``_meta.json``
``scorecard_kind``; with ``--scoring``, checks exactly that one file
(the reviewer's staging-dir self-check path — a ``_summary.md`` path
routes to the machine-summary parser, a ``scoring.md`` to the table
parser). The body file is auto-detected inside the version dir:
``<slug>.md`` (the #295 slug-echo shape — memo, essay) first, then the
per-skill fixed names in :data:`FIXED_BODY_NAMES` order: ``main.tex``
(pub), ``report.md`` (report), ``deck.md`` (deck, slides),
``proposal.tex`` (proposal), ``installation.tex`` (installation),
``datasheet.tex`` (datasheet), ``spec.tex`` (ip-uspto,
ip-uspto-provisional) — issue #475. (``numeric_consistency._body_path``
resolves only ``<slug>.md`` / ``main.tex``; that consumer set is
separate and deliberately untouched.) ``--body PATH`` overrides
discovery for adopted-in-place legacy threads whose entry point isn't
``<slug>.md``/:data:`FIXED_BODY_NAMES` (e.g. a ``paper.tex``); the
resolved (portfolio-relative) path is what ``body_path`` records.
``.tex`` bodies match verbatim with the symmetric dash fold — no
per-format normalization branch.

Writes a JSON summary to stdout. Exit codes: ``0`` clean, ``1`` one or
more findings, ``2`` invocation error (missing version dir, body file,
or ``--scoring`` file) — the #462/#338/#337 convention.

    shipped ip command doc or worked example emits it. The ip skills
    (``ip-uspto``, ``ip-uspto-provisional``) actually write the
    machine-summary scorecard as a markdown TABLE (the same
    ``| # | Dimension | Weight | Score | Justification |`` shape the
    human-verdict path uses; ``critics.py`` and
    ``snippets/scorecard_kind.md`` are the contract). When a ``_summary.md``
    instead carries a fenced ```json``` block with a ``dimensions``
    object — each key a rubric dimension mapping to ``null`` (un-owned)
    or an object with ``score`` + ``justification`` (+ optional
    ``weight``) — this parser reads it; otherwise it returns an empty
    list and :func:`check_summary_text` falls back to the table parser.
    This parser:

    - extracts every fenced ```json``` block and uses the first one
      that parses to an object carrying a ``dimensions`` mapping
      (tolerating a sibling ``rubric`` / ``critical_flag`` key — only
      ``dimensions`` is read);
    - emits one :class:`SummaryDimension` per dimension entry,
      ``json.loads``-coercing the ``score`` and reading ``justification``
      (a missing/``null`` justification becomes ``None``);
    - reads the per-dim ``weight`` when present (provisional D9 is ``/6``;
      most dims are ``/5``); when absent, defaults the weight to the
      dim's own score so a full-score by-absence justification still
      clears rule 2 — un-stamped weight never blocks the
      ceiling-by-absence pass.

    A ``null`` dimension value (un-owned dim) emits a row with
    ``score=None`` (skipped by the caller, parallel to the table path's
    ``null``-score rows). Malformed / absent JSON, or a block without a
    ``dimensions`` mapping, returns an empty list — never raises.
