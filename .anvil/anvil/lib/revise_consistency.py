"""Deterministic stale-token sweep for the ``*-revise`` lifecycle.

This module is the third member of Anvil's deterministic-checks family
(alongside ``anvil/lib/render_gate.py`` for compiled-PDF gating and
``anvil/lib/marp_lint.py`` for slide-source linting). It
catches a *content-integrity* failure mode that the LLM reviser silently
misses today: when a sourced number on a slide is rewritten between
``<thread>.{N}/deck.md`` and ``<thread>.{N+1}/deck.md`` (e.g. ``$54B+``
collapses to ``$25.9B`` because the prior verdict flagged a market-math
critical), the corresponding figure-script annotation / speaker-notes
phrasing / CSV row often does NOT get updated. The rendered PDF then
ships with the slide body asserting one number and the chart caption
asserting another — exactly the kind of contradiction a sophisticated
investor would catch on first read.

The pattern surfaced on the studio canary in two artifacts in the same
wave (bower.v3 — slide ↔ figure script; draftwell.v3 — slide ↔ speaker
notes); see issue #113 for the full motivation.

Three sub-cases, one primitive
-------------------------------

The reviser-staleness pattern reduces to: *given an old artifact and a
new artifact, find tokens present in the old that were removed; flag
those removed tokens wherever they still appear in companion files.*

That primitive covers all three observed sub-cases:

- (a) ``deck.md`` ↔ ``figures/src/*.{py,csv,mmd}``
- (b) ``deck.md`` ↔ ``speaker-notes.md``
- (c) ``figure.py`` ↔ ``figure.csv``

Design choices
--------------

- **Pure regex, no LLM.** Mirrors ``render_gate`` and ``marp_lint``: the
  deterministic-checks family stays cheap and predictable. The LLM
  reviser *consumes* findings; it does not do the detection.
- **Warn-only.** Findings emit at ``severity="minor"``. False positives
  are possible (a companion can legitimately reference the same number
  for an unrelated reason); the operator/reviser must read each one. A
  ``blocker`` severity would force ``Verdict.BLOCK``, which is too
  strong for v1.
- **``Kind.TOOL_EVIDENCE``.** The sweep IS a tool — it greps files. The
  ``Review`` shape matches ``render_gate.GateResult.to_review`` almost
  verbatim: a single null-scored ``Score`` so the schema validates, one
  ``Finding`` per ``StaleFinding`` with ``tool_calls=[]`` to satisfy
  the kind-required-fields validator, and no ``CriticalFlag`` emission.
- **Empty-findings cleanliness.** ``passed()`` is true on an empty
  result. Skill wiring writes ``_consistency.md`` *only* when findings
  exist, and appends to ``_revision-log.md`` only when written; no noise
  on a clean revision.

Two safety rules eliminate most false positives without an allowlist
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Only removed tokens are candidates.** A token appearing in both
   ``old_source`` and ``new_source`` is *not* flagged, even if it also
   appears in a companion. The source is still asserting that number, so
   the companion's reference is current.
2. **Tokens surviving in ``new_source`` are filtered.** Even among
   "removed" tokens (present in the extracted set difference), if the
   literal token text still appears anywhere in ``new_source``, it is
   *not* flagged. This catches the move-within-file case: the token may
   have shifted slides but is still asserted by the new artifact.

The flag fires only when a companion contains a token that the new
source has *fully dropped*. Operators can extend filtering further via
``ignore_tokens``; the default allowlist is empty.

Public API
----------

- ``sweep(old_source, new_source, companion_files, *, token_set,
  ignore_tokens) -> ConsistencyResult``.
- ``ConsistencyResult`` with ``passed()``, ``to_json()``, and
  ``to_review(version_dir, critic_id)``.
- ``StaleFinding`` — one (companion, line, token) triple.
- ``TokenSet`` / ``DEFAULT_TOKEN_SET`` — regex pack governing what
  counts as a priced-number token. Default set covers money, money
  ranges, percent, and percent ranges (including en-dash ranges; the
  draftwell canary specifically hit ``$25–33M`` with an en-dash).
- ``DEFAULT_COMPANION_GLOBS`` — file globs the caller typically scans.
  Includes ``*.tex`` for forward-compat with LaTeX skills (memo / pub /
  report / installation / proposal / ip-uspto), which are expected to
  adopt the sweep as their own canaries surface. Deck-revise (the v1
  caller) only invokes against ``*.py``, ``*.csv``, ``*.mmd``, and
  ``speaker-notes.md``; ``*.tex`` is dormant until a LaTeX skill wires
  in.
- ``DEFAULT_IGNORE_TOKENS`` — empty ``frozenset()``. Operators extend
  per-thread via the ``ignore_tokens`` parameter.
