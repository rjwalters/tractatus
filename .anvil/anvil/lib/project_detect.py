"""Project shape detection — shared framework primitive (issues #297, #407).

Born as ``anvil/skills/project-migrate/lib/detect.py`` (issue #297).
Promoted to ``anvil/lib/`` when ``anvil:project-scout`` (issue #407) became
the second consumer of the detector core — the CLAUDE.md "wait for the
second consumer before generalizing" trigger (#10/#26/#69/#102/#382/#393
pattern). The historical import path is preserved by a full-fidelity
re-export shim at ``anvil/skills/project-migrate/lib/detect.py``, so
project-migrate's lib siblings (``plan``, ``apply``, ``enroll``,
``verify``, ``orchestrate``) and its test suite run unchanged.

Given a project directory, classify its on-disk shape so the planner can
choose the right migration steps. Three shapes are recognized:

- ``Shape.FULLY_MIGRATED`` — post-#296 target: project-level ``BRIEF.md``
  absorbs all per-doc config; every thread lives at
  ``<project>/<slug>/<slug>.N/<slug>.md``.
- ``Shape.POST_283_ANVIL_JSON`` — project-level ``BRIEF.md`` exists with
  ``documents:`` listed, but per-thread ``.anvil.json`` files persist and/or
  body filenames are still skill-fixed (``memo.md``).
- ``Shape.PRE_283_CLASSIC`` — no project-level ``BRIEF.md``; ``memo.N/``
  sibling version dirs directly under the project root; skill-fixed
  ``memo.md`` bodies. This shape ALSO covers the nested-but-flat
  deck/slides/proposal variant (issue #382 — the studio canary's
  ``series-a-deck`` shape): a thread-root directory (``<slug>/`` with
  BRIEF + refs + assets) sitting as a sibling of flat ``<slug>.N/``
  version dirs at the project root. The slug heuristic resolves the
  stem itself as the slug (the stem is not a skill name), and any
  per-thread ``.anvil.json`` inside the thread root is recorded for
  the BRIEF merge.

``Shape.UNKNOWN`` is returned for inputs that don't match any of the three
patterns (e.g., an empty directory, or a directory whose contents look like
non-anvil project material).

Design notes
------------
- **Pure detector — no mutations.** The detection routine reads files but
  never writes. This is load-bearing for the dry-run contract: the same code
  path that drives ``/anvil:project-migrate`` (dry-run) and
  ``/anvil:project-migrate --apply`` (apply) goes through detection, and
  detection MUST never touch disk.
- **Skill-local first, lib promotion later.** Lived under
  ``anvil/skills/project-migrate/lib/`` per the CLAUDE.md pattern until
  ``anvil:project-scout`` (#407) became the second consumer; now canonical
  here, with the skill-local path kept as a re-export shim.
- **No new Python deps.** Uses ``pyyaml`` (already a base dep via
  ``project_brief.py``) only for ``.anvil.json`` is JSON-only (stdlib) and
  the BRIEF frontmatter check is a thin reuse of the existing
  ``project_discovery.has_project_brief`` helper through a path manipulation
  shim (we vendor the small predicate logic here to avoid a fragile import
  chain at install time).

Public API
----------

- ``Shape`` — IntEnum of recognized shapes.
- ``ProjectInventory`` — typed snapshot of what the detector found
  (per-slug directory list, per-slug ``.anvil.json`` presence, etc.).
- ``detect_shape(project_dir)`` — top-level classifier.
- ``inventory_project(project_dir)`` — return the typed inventory without
  collapsing it to a single ``Shape``.

    version_dirs
        Sorted list of `<stem>.<N>` directories belonging to this thread.
    body_filenames
        The set of body filenames observed across the version dirs. The
        canonical post-#295 form is `{<slug>.md}`; pre-#295 threads carry
        skill-fixed names like `{memo.md}`. Mixed sets surface as a
