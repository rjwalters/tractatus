r"""Recursive ``\input``/``\include`` resolver for multi-file LaTeX threads.

Issue #643: ``pub`` is the one anvil skill explicitly designed for
genuinely multi-file LaTeX documents — a master ``main.tex`` that
``\input{sections/...}``s many section files is a normal, expected
whitepaper shape. But the review/verify pipeline historically named only
the master file (``pub-review.md`` step 4 "load ``main.tex``", the
``source_paths`` list at step 4b, and ``evidence_check.py``'s single-file
body detection), so a reviewer that obeyed the literal instruction scored
a near-empty ~90-line shell against the /44 rubric and silently missed the
entire paper body.

There is (was) **no** ``\input``/``\include`` resolver anywhere in the
codebase — ``render_gate.py``'s ``source_paths`` is a caller-supplied path
list, not a walker (verified in the issue #643 curation). This module is
the missing primitive. It ships lib-scoped (not skill-local) because three
consumers exist on day one: (1) ``pub-review.md`` step 4's content read,
(2) step 4b's render-gate ``source_paths`` construction, and (3)
``evidence_check.py``'s quote-verification body (a reviewer that now reads
the full body but whose quote-verifier only checks ``main.tex`` would
otherwise emit false ``fabricated_evidence`` findings for legitimate quotes
drawn from ``\input``-ed children).

Resolver behavior (each verified explicitly in ``tests/lib/test_tex_includes.py``):

- Recognizes ``\input{path}`` and ``\include{path}`` (braced form) and the
  brace-less ``\input path`` form (whitespace-terminated).
- ``.tex`` extension defaulting: ``\input{sections/intro}`` resolves to
  ``sections/intro.tex``; ``\input{sections/intro.tex}`` (extension already
  present) is NOT doubled to ``sections/intro.tex.tex``.
- Nested ``\input``: a child that itself ``\input``s further files is
  walked recursively (depth-first, document order).
- Comment-awareness: an ``\input{...}`` after an unescaped ``%`` on the
  same line (a LaTeX comment) is NOT resolved — reuses the same
  comment-masking primitive precedent as ``numeric_consistency._mask_text``
  (``latex=True``): the ``(?<!\\)%[^\n]*`` rule.
- Missing target: an ``\input``/``\include`` whose file is absent on disk
  does NOT crash — it is surfaced as a ``missing`` entry (a dangling
  ``\input`` is itself useful reviewer signal: a broken document).
- Cycle guard: two files ``\input``-ing each other (malformed but possible)
  do NOT infinite-loop — visited real paths are tracked.

The module is pure-stdlib (no third-party deps), mirroring
``numeric_consistency.py``'s subprocess-free posture.

    Two resolution roots are tried, in order:

    1. The **job directory** (``job_dir``, the master file's directory) —
       LaTeX's own semantics: a compile run is rooted at the master, so
       ``\input``/``\include`` targets (even inside nested children) are
       conventionally written relative to the job root. This is the
       overwhelmingly common real-paper shape (e.g. a ``sections/method.tex``
       that ``\input{sections/details}`` — the path is job-relative, not
       child-relative).
    2. The **including file's directory** (``including_dir``) — the fallback
       for the rarer relative-to-child authoring style.

    The first candidate that exists on disk wins (checked by the caller);
    both are returned so a fully-missing target can report the job-relative
    form (candidate 1) as its canonical ``missing`` entry.
