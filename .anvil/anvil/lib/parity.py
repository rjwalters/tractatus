"""Pre-flight lint: shared hard claims between sibling ``deck.md`` and ``memo.md``.

Detects **deck↔memo parity drift** — a load-bearing hard claim that lives in
one artifact but not its sibling. The classic failure mode is a memo revision
that pulls ahead of the deck (or vice versa) on a number / date / acronym
that both artifacts are supposed to share. Each pipeline (`anvil:memo`,
`anvil:deck`) advances on its own cadence under its own critic, so without
this check there is no point in the lifecycle where a shared hard-claim
universe is reconciled — the canary failure mode that surfaced this module.

This module is the **shared library promotion** of the two near-byte-identical
skill-local mirrors that shipped first:

- ``anvil/skills/deck/lib/parity_lint.py`` (PR #205, first consumer, issue #200)
- ``anvil/skills/memo/lib/parity_lint.py`` (PR #215, second consumer)

Per CLAUDE.md §"Skill-local first, lib promotion later" — "wait for the second
consumer before generalizing." The second-consumer trigger fired on PR #215's
merge and this promotion (issue #317) is the canonical one-line import-path
swap that the two skill-local docstrings already named as the target.

Canary friction (issue #200, mirrored by issue #215)
----------------------------------------------------
Studio canary, 2026-06-01 portfolio review/revise pass: Citation Clear was
the first studio venture with both memo and deck pipelines shipped
(memo.3 + deck.3 at 35/40 advance:TRUE). During the revise pass, the
reviser introduced a load-bearing insurer benchmark — "~50–60% completion"
— into memo.4 that deck.3 lacked. **No anvil primitive detected this
drift.** Shared hard claims (FTC $193K / 5-0 / Jan 2025, NYC FY24 26.6%,
SFMTA $126M+ since April 2024, pricing $8.99/$29.99, kill thresholds)
silently drift across independent revision cycles. The studio cohort now
has ~10 threads on both `anvil:memo` and `anvil:deck` — every one is a
future drift surface.

The reference implementation pattern (``Finding`` / ``LintResult`` /
``_LINT_DISABLE_RE`` / ``lint_source`` / ``lint_<artifact>``) descends from
``anvil/skills/deck/lib/marp_lint.py`` and the parallel
``anvil/skills/memo/lib/memo_image_refs.py``. The shared-lib promotion
preserves the per-side wrapper contract (``lint_deck_memo_parity`` /
``lint_memo_deck_parity``) and the per-side rule name
(``deck_memo_parity`` / ``memo_deck_parity``) so the two ``*-review.md``
command files remain byte-identical pre- and post-promotion.

Second-consumer trigger fired on merge of #215
----------------------------------------------
Per CLAUDE.md §"Skill-local first, lib promotion later" — "wait for the second
consumer before generalizing." With both ``anvil/skills/deck/lib/parity_lint.py``
(PR #205, first consumer) and ``anvil/skills/memo/lib/parity_lint.py`` (PR
#215, second consumer) on disk, the trigger condition was satisfied for the
first time. This module is the resulting promotion; both skill-local modules
are now thin re-exports.

Load-bearingness filter (issue #553)
------------------------------------
v0 of this lint fired one undifferentiated "drift" warning per ``only_in_memo``
token. The canary failure mode that surfaced this issue (Docent, 2026-06-12)
was that thin-deck-vs-rich-memo is the **expected** steady state — decks are
legitimately terser than memos. The operator (correctly) treated all 38
``only_in_memo`` warnings on Docent as the "accept the divergence" branch and
bulk-dismissed them. A **load-bearing economic drop** (a ``$/seat``
contribution-margin number with no deck-side counterpart) hid in that noise.

The fix is **not** a new direction — both directions already emit. It is a
**load-bearingness filter** layered over the existing ``only_in_memo`` set
that promotes the load-bearing-economic subset to a new sharper warning class
(``side="only_in_memo_economic"``) the reviser consults before deciding to
bulk-dismiss.

**Schema choice (Option A from the issue #553 curator brief)**: ``side`` is
extended to the Literal value ``"only_in_memo_economic"`` and ``LintResult``
exposes the promoted subset via a new ``only_in_memo_economic`` property
paralleling ``only_in_memo`` / ``only_in_deck``. **Invariants**:

- ``only_in_memo`` is **unchanged** — it still carries the full set of tokens
  present in memo but absent from deck. The promoted subset is **additive**
  surfacing; legacy consumers reading ``only_in_memo`` see byte-identical
  behavior.
- ``set(only_in_memo_economic) ⊆ set(only_in_memo)``. A token promoted to the
  economic subset is also recorded as an ``only_in_memo`` finding (under a
  separate ``Finding`` with ``side="only_in_memo"``) so the full set is
  observable without traversing the economic subset.
- The classifier respects the existing ``<!-- anvil-lint-disable:
  <rule> -->`` escape hatch — a suppressed token is downgraded to ``info``
  on **both** the ``only_in_memo`` and the ``only_in_memo_economic`` findings;
  no second escape mechanism.
- Phase A severity preserved: promoted findings ship at ``severity="warning"``
  (or ``"info"`` if suppressed). They do NOT promote to ``"error"``.

**Heuristic** (deliberately conservative — false-negative-tolerant):

- A token is *load-bearing-economic* if (a) its extractor rule label is
  ``money``, ``percent``, or ``unit_int`` AND (b) the memo source line
  carrying the token co-occurs (same line, or within ±3 lines) with one of
  :data:`ECONOMIC_CONTEXT_VOCABULARY` (attach / ARPU / ACV / ARR / MRR / LTV
  / CAC / margin / payback / kill threshold / unit economics / take rate /
  rev share / pricing / conversion / churn / retention / GMV / TAM / SAM /
  SOM).
- Bare acronym tokens (e.g., ``FTC``, ``SFMTA``) are **NOT** promoted —
  acronyms appearing in regulatory-background prose remain undifferentiated
  ``only_in_memo`` noise. The narrow "money / percent / unit_int near
  economic-context vocab" cut is the v0 calibration; vocabulary drift is
  expected as the canary surfaces real false positives.

**Phase A non-gating** preserved: economic-subset findings ship at warning
severity, do NOT contribute to ``lint_critical_flag``, and do NOT force
``advance: false``. The reviser side (``deck-revise``) is responsible for
treating the promoted subset with sharper framing ("memo carried this
substance; the deck dropped it — was that deliberate?") instead of the bulk
"drift, reconcile" framing the v0 ``only_in_memo`` warnings carry.

Phase A / Phase B (warning vs. error severity)
----------------------------------------------
v0 ships at **`warning` severity** for every parity finding. The lint is
*observational* on first ship: it surfaces drift in `findings.md` and the
operator's next-step list, but does NOT contribute to the
``lint_critical_flag`` and does NOT force ``advance: false``. The
``deck-review`` verdict aggregation (step 12) and ``memo-review`` verdict
aggregation (step 7) are byte-identical to a thread without the parity lint
enabled.

Phase B promotion to ``error`` (and therefore ``advance: false``-gating)
is a separate decision deferred 2–4 weeks after Phase A merge, based on
canary consumption signal — does the warning fire reliably on actionable
drift, or is the false-positive volume too high? This Phase A / Phase B
ship-with-falsifiability pattern (single named consumer + bounded
observation window + explicit kill-switch criterion) is the framework's
established negative-result discipline; see ``WORK_LOG.md`` 2026-06-02
(issue #227) for the canonical kill-switch precedent — a Phase A
primitive that did not survive its bounded canary window and was cleanly
retracted. The pattern itself — ship-with-falsifiability, observe,
retract-cleanly — is what carries forward here.

What the lint does (v0)
-----------------------

Both wrappers (``lint_deck_memo_parity`` and ``lint_memo_deck_parity``)
share the same core:

1. **Graceful-skip when no sibling.** If the sibling version dir is
   ``None`` or the sibling body is missing, returns
   ``LintResult(skipped=True, reason="...")`` with no findings. The
   single-pipeline case (most non-Studio consumers, and Studio threads
   where only one pipeline has shipped) is the common path; the lint is
   intentionally inert there. The host review proceeds normally.
2. **Hard-claim extraction.** Apply a small set of conservative regex
   extractors over both bodies (see :data:`EXTRACTORS`):

   - **Money**: ``$XXK/M/B``, decimal prices (``$8.99``, ``$29.99``).
   - **Percentages**: ``26.6%``, ``50–60%`` (en-dash range), ``50-60%``
     (ascii range).
   - **Dates / quarters / FY**: ``Q1 FY24``, ``FY2024``, ``20XX``.
   - **Named months + year**: ``Jan 2025``, ``April 2024``.
   - **ALL-CAPS acronyms** (length 2–6): ``FTC``, ``SFMTA``, ``NYC``,
     ``LOI``. Conservative bound (length 2–6) deliberately rejects prose
     ALL-CAPS (``WHO``, ``DO NOT``, etc.) and over-long token strings.
   - **Unit-bearing integers**: ``8 pilots``, ``50 LOIs``, ``250k
     plants``. The unit vocabulary is small and conservative (see
     :data:`UNIT_VOCABULARY`).

   Each match is captured as a ``(token, line_number)`` pair so the
   diagnostic is grounded.
3. **Set comparison.** Two sets of tokens — one per artifact body —
   are compared by **exact-string equality**. Semantic equivalence
   (``$193K`` vs ``$193,000`` vs ``193 thousand``) is **explicitly
   deferred** to a follow-on issue. v0 surfaces ``only_in_memo`` and
   ``only_in_deck`` lists.
4. **Findings.** One ``Finding`` per token in ``only_in_memo`` or
   ``only_in_deck`` at ``severity="warning"`` (v0 contract). The
   ``Finding.side`` values (``"only_in_memo"`` / ``"only_in_deck"``) are
   preserved verbatim across both wrappers — they describe *which body
   the token came from*, independent of which side is "primary".
5. **Escape hatch.** ``<!-- anvil-lint-disable: <rule> -->`` on the
   line of (or immediately above) a deliberately-one-sided claim
   **downgrades that finding to ``info``**. The mechanism mirrors
   ``marp_lint`` and ``memo_image_refs`` exactly.

What v0 explicitly defers (remains queued against this lib module)
------------------------------------------------------------------

- **Semantic-equivalence matching** (``$193K`` ↔ ``$193,000``): follow-on
  if the canary surfaces high false-positive volume.
- **Promotion to ``error`` severity** (Phase B): follow-on after 2–4 weeks
  of canary consumption signal.
- **Standalone ``/anvil:parity-check <thread>`` command**: not in v0; the
  ``deck-review`` step 5d / ``memo-review`` step 4d invocations are the
  carriers.
- **Centralizing sibling-version discovery inside the wrapper**: still
  caller's responsibility in v0 (mirrors the pre-promotion contract).

Public API
----------
``lint_source(deck_source, memo_source, *, rule="deck_memo_parity") -> LintResult``
    Generic core that operates on two in-memory strings. The default
    ``rule`` preserves deck-side semantics so the existing deck-side
    ``lint_source(deck_source, memo_source)`` call is byte-compatible.
    Memo-side wrapper passes ``rule="memo_deck_parity"``.
``lint_deck_memo_parity(deck_version_dir, memo_version_dir) -> LintResult``
    Deck-side file wrapper. Discovers the source files inside the
    version dirs and handles the graceful-skip path.
``lint_memo_deck_parity(memo_version_dir, deck_version_dir) -> LintResult``
    Memo-side file wrapper. Symmetric to ``lint_deck_memo_parity`` with
    primary/sibling roles swapped.
``lint_parity(primary_path, sibling_path, primary_kind, sibling_kind) -> LintResult``
    Unified wrapper dispatching to the deck-side or memo-side primary-
    artifact framing based on ``primary_kind``. Centralizes the
    sibling-pair surface that future versions can grow into.
