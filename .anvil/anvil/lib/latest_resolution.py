"""Canonical ``.latest`` resolution for memo thread version directories
(issue #288, sub-deliverable 5 of #283).

This module ships the **single source of truth** for resolving a
``<slug>.latest`` reference to a concrete version directory on disk —
and, since issue #473, for **maintaining** the convenience symlinks
(:func:`update_latest_symlinks`, wired into the memo lifecycle via
``anvil/skills/memo/lib/latest_phase.py``). Issue #288's curator
recommendation — **option (c): pure tolerance** — originally left the
symlinks consumer-maintained; the studio canary surfaced that the
consumer-side convention was agent-invisible (#473), so the contract is
now *framework-maintained by default, consumer-pinnable* (see
``anvil/lib/snippets/version_layout.md`` §"Convenience ``.latest``
symlinks"). The **read side is unchanged**: every code path that has
to resolve a symbolic ``.latest`` reference goes through
:func:`resolve_latest`, which tolerates four on-disk shapes:

1. ``<thread_dir>/<slug>.latest`` exists as a **symlink** pointing at a
   ``<slug>.<N>/`` directory. The author pinned the symlink to a
   specific version (the load-bearing case for intentional pinning to a
   non-highest version — e.g., "publish ``.latest`` against the
   reviewed-and-AUDITED v3 even though v4 is in progress").
2. ``<thread_dir>/<slug>.latest`` exists as a **real directory** (no
   symlink). This is the rarer case — typically the operator hasn't
   migrated to the symlink convention yet, or is on a filesystem where
   symlinks are awkward (Windows without WSL).
3. No ``<slug>.latest`` of any shape, but one or more
   ``<slug>.<N>/`` sibling directories exist. The helper walks the
   children and returns the **highest-numbered** one. This is the
   walk-to-highest fallback — the load-bearing path for the "operator
   never created the symlink" case (the canary's common case today
   per #288's option (c) rationale).
4. None of the above — no symlink, no ``.latest/`` directory, no
   ``<slug>.<N>/`` siblings. The helper returns ``None``, leaving the
   caller to surface a clean "no version dirs" error to the operator.

Precedence is fixed: 1 > 2 > 3 > 4. **A pinned symlink always wins**
over walk-to-highest — an author who intentionally pins ``.latest`` to
v3 even though v4 exists gets v3 from this helper. This is the
load-bearing AC from the issue: "If ``<slug>.latest`` symlink exists, it
takes precedence (an author can pin ``.latest`` to a non-highest version
intentionally)."

Public API
----------

``resolve_latest(thread_dir: Path, slug: str) -> Optional[Path]``
    The canonical resolver. Returns the path to the resolved version
    directory (which may be the ``.latest`` symlink-or-directory itself,
    or the highest-numbered ``<slug>.<N>/``), or ``None`` when no
    resolution is possible. **Non-throwing**: filesystem errors during
    traversal degrade to ``None`` rather than propagating, mirroring the
    lenient-form precedent across the memo lib (``refs_resolver``,
    ``project_discovery``, ``project_brief``).

``update_latest_symlinks(thread_dir: Path, slug: str, *, force: bool = False) -> list[LatestSymlinkUpdate]``
    The canonical **writer** (issue #473). Creates or re-points the
    convenience symlinks ``<slug>.latest -> <slug>.{max_N}`` and
    ``<slug>.latest.review -> <slug>.{max_review_N}.review`` (plus any
    already-existing ``<slug>.latest.<tag>`` family) with **relative**
    targets — ``ln -sfn`` semantics. Each suffix family is handled
    independently. The steady-lifecycle stale link (still on the
    immediately-superseded version, set before the new highest existed)
    re-points freely; every other resolvable non-highest symlink is
    presumptively an operator **pin** and preserved by default — the
    #288 pin-honoring AC — re-pointed only under ``force=True``. A real
    ``.latest/`` *directory* (non-symlink) is never replaced, force or
    not. Non-throwing: per-family ``OSError`` degrades to a ``skipped``
    record rather than propagating.

``LatestSymlinkUpdate``
    The per-family outcome record returned by
    ``update_latest_symlinks`` (``link_name`` / ``target`` / ``action``
    / ``note``).

``LATEST``
    The literal string ``"latest"`` — the symbolic version specifier.
    Re-exported here as the single source of truth so callers that
    construct ``.latest`` paths (e.g., the cross-thread parser's regex)
    can reference one constant.

Relationship to ``cross_thread_refs``
-------------------------------------

Before this module shipped, the same walk-to-highest logic lived
privately inside ``cross_thread_refs._resolve_latest_version_dir`` (#287
/ PR #291). This module **extracts** that helper into a reusable public
surface so other call sites — intra-thread ``.latest`` resolution,
future ``memo-draft`` / ``memo-revise`` path resolution, downstream
tooling — can share the contract without re-implementing the regex or
the symlink-precedence rule. ``cross_thread_refs`` now delegates to
``resolve_latest`` to preserve a single source of truth.

Skill-local first
-----------------

Lives under ``anvil/skills/memo/lib/`` per the CLAUDE.md "skill-local
first, lib promotion later" pattern. Promotion to ``anvil/lib/`` is
queued for the second-consumer trigger (likely ``anvil:proposal`` —
which has its own portfolio shape — or ``anvil:pub``). Until then the
module has zero ``anvil.*`` runtime imports.

No new Python deps
------------------

Standard library only (``re``, ``pathlib``, ``typing``). The CLAUDE.md
"Python deps: subprocess-only by default" contract is preserved.

def resolve_latest(thread_dir: Path, slug: str) -> Optional[Path]:
    """Resolve ``<slug>.latest`` to a concrete version directory on disk.

    The canonical four-step resolution rule per issue #288 option (c):

    1. If ``<thread_dir>/<slug>.latest`` exists as a **symlink** (whether
       resolvable or dangling-but-listed), return it. Symlink wins
       unconditionally — an author can pin ``.latest`` to a non-highest
       version intentionally.
    2. Else if ``<thread_dir>/<slug>.latest`` exists as a **real
       directory** (not a symlink), return it.
    3. Else, enumerate ``<thread_dir>/<slug>.<N>/`` for all integer ``N``,
       pick the highest, and return that directory.
    4. Else, return ``None``. No version dirs and no symlink — the
       caller should surface a clean "no version dirs" error.

    Parameters
    ----------
    thread_dir
        The parent directory that contains the thread's version dirs.
        For a thread at ``<portfolio>/investment-memo/`` with version
        dirs ``investment-memo.1/``, ``investment-memo.2/``, this is
        ``<portfolio>/investment-memo/``. For the cross-thread case,
        this is the sibling thread's directory under the portfolio root.
    slug
        The thread slug — the stem of the version dirs. For an
        ``investment-memo`` thread, slug is ``"investment-memo"`` and the
        helper looks for ``investment-memo.latest``,
        ``investment-memo.1``, ``investment-memo.2``, etc.

    Returns
    -------
    Path or None
        The resolved version directory path. **Note**: when steps 1 or 2
        fire, the return is the literal ``<thread_dir>/<slug>.latest``
        path (not the dereferenced target) — this matches the
        cross-thread resolver's pre-#288 behavior where the operator-
        visible path is what gets recorded in ``comments.md``. Callers
        that need the dereferenced target call ``.resolve()`` themselves.
        Returns ``None`` when no resolution is possible.

    Notes
    -----
    **Non-throwing**: any ``OSError`` during directory traversal (a
    symlink loop, a permission error, a vanished directory) degrades to
    ``None`` rather than propagating. The lenient-form precedent across
    the memo lib (``refs_resolver``, ``project_discovery``,
    ``project_brief``) is the consumer-friendly contract — errors surface
    as findings, not exceptions.

    **Symlink precedence**: a symlink at ``<slug>.latest`` wins even if
    its target does not exist (e.g., a dangling symlink left over from
    a deleted version dir). The caller is responsible for handling the
    case where the returned path's children do not exist — the
    cross-thread resolver, for example, surfaces such cases as
    ``"file not found"`` reasons on the higher-level resolution.

    Examples
    --------
    Symlink precedence (intentional pin to non-highest)::

        # On disk:
        #   <thread_dir>/<slug>.1/
        #   <thread_dir>/<slug>.2/
        #   <thread_dir>/<slug>.3/
        #   <thread_dir>/<slug>.latest -> <slug>.2  (pinned)
        # Returns: <thread_dir>/<slug>.latest (the symlink path)

    Walk-to-highest (no symlink)::

        # On disk:
        #   <thread_dir>/<slug>.1/
        #   <thread_dir>/<slug>.2/
        #   <thread_dir>/<slug>.7/
        # Returns: <thread_dir>/<slug>.7

    Real directory at ``.latest`` (no symlink)::

        # On disk:
        #   <thread_dir>/<slug>.1/
        #   <thread_dir>/<slug>.latest/    (real dir, not a symlink)

    """Create / re-point the ``<slug>.latest*`` convenience symlinks.

    The canonical writer half of the ``.latest`` convention (issue
    #473), wired into the memo lifecycle via the
    ``anvil/skills/memo/lib/latest_phase.py`` CLI. Each suffix family is
    handled **independently**:

    - ``<slug>.latest`` → the highest ``<slug>.{N}/`` version dir.
    - ``<slug>.latest.review`` → the highest ``<slug>.{N}.review/``
      critic sibling (maintained by default — the studio-canary pair;
      note it may lag ``<slug>.latest`` by one when the newest version
      has not been reviewed yet).
    - ``<slug>.latest.<tag>`` for any other tag → maintained **only
      when the symlink already exists** (the framework re-points what
      the operator opted into; it does not invent new tag families).

    Symlink targets are **relative** basenames (``acme.latest ->
    acme.3``), matching the documented ``ln -sfn`` idiom and keeping
    the links portable across repo moves/clones.

    Update rule per family (the #288/#473 pin-preservation contract):

    - **No entry** at the ``.latest`` name → create the symlink.
    - **Symlink already pointing at the highest** version → no-op
      (``unchanged``); a non-canonical link text to the same
      destination is normalized to the relative form.
    - **Symlink resolving to a real, non-highest** version dir → two
      shapes, discriminated by the steady-lifecycle signature:

      - the **superseded tracking link** — it points at the
        immediately-superseded (second-highest) member AND the symlink
        itself predates the new highest dir (lstat mtime comparison) —
        is re-pointed freely. This is the normal post-write shape and
        the #473 tracking AC.
      - **everything else** is presumptively an intentional operator
        pin (#288's load-bearing AC): a link set *after* a newer
        version already existed, or lagging by more than one version,
        or pointing outside the enumerable family. Preserved with a
        ``pinned`` record unless ``force=True``.

    - **Dangling symlink** → repaired freely (re-pointed at the
      highest version).
    - **Real directory (or any non-symlink entry)** at the ``.latest``
      name → never replaced (``refused-real-dir``), force or not.

    Returns the per-family outcome records; an **empty list** means the
    thread dir had no version dirs and no ``.latest`` entries (the
    empty-thread no-op). **Non-throwing**: a per-family ``OSError``
    degrades to a ``skipped`` record; a missing/unreadable
    ``thread_dir`` returns ``[]``.
