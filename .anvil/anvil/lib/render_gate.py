"""Deterministic render-gate for paginated Anvil artifacts.

This is the LaTeX-skill analog of ``anvil/lib/marp_lint.py``: a
cheap, deterministic pre-flight gate over a compiled PDF (and its compile
log + sources) that runs *before* the expensive content review. It checks
four properties:

1. **Page fit** — page count of the PDF against an optional cap (skill-set,
   per-thread overridable via ``.anvil.json``). When ``page_cap`` is ``None``
   the check is skipped (a first-class no-op — the common case).
2. **Overfull boxes** — greps the LaTeX log for ``Overfull \\hbox`` /
   ``Overfull \\vbox`` advisories whose numeric amount exceeds
   ``overfull_threshold_pt`` (default ``5.0pt``).
3. **Compile success** — non-zero engine exit OR missing output PDF.
4. **Placeholders** — scans source files for ``TODO`` / ``[TBD]`` /
   ``(figure)`` / missing-include patterns, with per-skill extras.

Memo mode (``kind="memo"``)
---------------------------

When invoked with ``kind="memo"``, the gate routes through a separate
seven-dimension flow tailored to the ``anvil:memo`` markdown → PDF
rendering pipeline shipped by Epic #158. The seven memo checks are:

1. ``memo_compile_success`` — pandoc exited 0, the PDF exists, and the
   page count is positive.
2. ``memo_page_fit`` — rendered page count vs ``target_length.pages``
   (error) or the 400-wpp-converted ``target_length.words`` range
   (warning). Not run when ``target_length`` is absent.
3. ``memo_overfull_check`` — pandoc / weasyprint / wkhtmltopdf stderr
   warnings about lines that don't break cleanly (warning severity;
   graceful-degrades when the renderer emits no such warnings).
4. ``memo_image_refs_exist`` — delegates to
   ``anvil/skills/memo/lib/memo_image_refs.py::lint_memo_image_refs``
   (PR #160) and aggregates findings. Source-side lint already runs at
   review phase; render-gate adds the post-render catch.
5. ``memo_image_dimensions`` — advisory image-dimension/aspect sanity
   check (issue #395). For every image referenced from the body plus
   every PNG/JPEG under ``<version_dir>/exhibits/``, three stdlib
   header checks (pure ``struct`` PNG-IHDR / JPEG-SOFn parsing — no
   PIL, no subprocess): (a) pixel ceiling — width or height >
   ``image_max_px`` (default :data:`MEMO_IMAGE_MAX_PX` = 6000 px);
   (b) extreme aspect — ratio > :data:`MEMO_IMAGE_MAX_ASPECT` (6:1)
   either direction; (c) declared-vs-actual — when a sibling
   ``src/<stem>.py`` declares a parseable ``figsize=(W, H)`` and a
   ``dpi=N`` (or the PNG carries a ``pHYs`` density chunk), flag
   actual dims diverging more than
   :data:`MEMO_IMAGE_DECLARED_TOLERANCE` (1.5×) from declared —
   silent skip when nothing declarative is parseable. A fourth check
   (d) content-bbox vs canvas — content occupying <
   :data:`MEMO_IMAGE_MIN_CONTENT_RATIO` (25%) of the canvas, the
   exact signature of the matplotlib ``bbox_inches="tight"`` +
   rogue-artist + transparent-canvas failure (the 16,622×5,652 px
   canary) — needs PIL/numpy via the ``[image_lint]`` extra,
   graceful-skips with a ``reasons`` breadcrumb when absent, and is
   skipped per-image for canvases already over the pixel ceiling
   (decoding a 90-megapixel image is the hazard, not the cure). ALL
   findings are warning severity and the dimension never joins
   ``failed_gates`` (the same advisory model as
   ``memo_overfull_check``: recorded in ``findings``, ``passed``
   unaffected, no ``CriticalFlag``). Suppression for body-referenced
   images via ``<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_image_dimensions -->``
   (suppressed hits surface as info findings).
6. ``memo_placeholder_scan`` — adapts ``DEFAULT_PLACEHOLDER_PATTERNS``
   for markdown comment syntax (``<!-- TODO -->``, ``[TBD]``,
   ``_TKTKTK_``). Suppression via
   ``<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_placeholder_scan -->``.
7. ``memo_rhetoric_lint`` — advisory deterministic rhetoric lint
   (issue #463). Delegates to
   ``anvil/lib/rhetoric_lint.py::lint_rhetoric`` over the body
   markdown: rule-set-driven phrase/trope/AI-tell scanning (phrase,
   regex, and frequency rule kinds; the framework default set is
   ``DEFAULT_RHETORIC_RULES`` plus the em-dash-density frequency
   rule). Fenced code blocks and HTML comments are excluded from the
   scan. Consumer rules merge over the defaults via the optional
   ``rhetoric_rules_path`` JSON file (wired from the #461 voice
   contract's ``voice.rhetoric_rules`` sub-key via
   ``anvil.lib.project_brief.resolve_rhetoric_rules`` — issue #468;
   memo-render step 4g is the caller); malformed
   consumer JSON graceful-degrades to a defaults-only run with one
   warning finding naming the parse error. ALL findings are warning
   severity (info when suppressed or consumer-downgraded) and the
   dimension never joins ``failed_gates`` — the same advisory model
   as ``memo_image_dimensions`` (#395): findings recorded in
   ``_progress.json.render_gate.findings``, ``passed`` unaffected,
   no ``CriticalFlag``. Per-line suppression via
   ``<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_rhetoric_lint -->`` (same line or
   line directly above; suppressed hits surface as info findings).
   Rationale: rhetoric rules have irreducible false positives (quoted
   material, deliberate style); dim 9 *Rhetorical economy* critics
   make the judgment call with this as mechanical evidence.

The memo path also owns ``_render_memo_source`` (the pandoc → weasyprint
OR wkhtmltopdf OR xelatex chain) with engine preflight via the
``check_*_available`` family in ``anvil/lib/render.py`` (added in #168).
Phase 3's ``memo-render`` command wires this into the skill; this module
is the shippable lib primitive without command changes.

Result composition mirrors ``marp_lint.LintResult``: a JSON-serializable
``GateResult`` that captures every finding, plus a typed ``Review``
(``kind=Kind.TOOL_EVIDENCE``) so the gate plugs into the existing
``anvil/lib/critics.py::aggregate`` + ``compute_verdict`` pipeline without
any schema or aggregator change. When the gate fails, the ``Review``
carries one ``CriticalFlag`` per failed dimension, which forces
``Verdict.BLOCK`` downstream.

page_cap calibration
--------------------

The memo gate's ``memo_page_fit`` dimension converts
``target_length.words`` into a rendered-page-count range via a
words-per-page (wpp) proxy. The default is :data:`MEMO_WORDS_PER_PAGE`
(**400 wpp**), which is calibrated for the **mixed-content** memo the
canary's investment-memo example assumes (prose body with occasional
tables). Pure dense-prose memos (no tables) run closer to 500-600 wpp,
while table-heavy memos (financial models, comp tables, sensitivity
matrices) run effectively ~300-350 wpp once the table whitespace is
accounted for — the 400-wpp default is the practical midpoint that
avoids systematically misfiring on table-dense memos.

The override hook is per-thread: callers can pass
``words_per_page=<positive number>`` to :func:`gate` (when
``kind="memo"``) to use a custom conversion factor for the
``target_length.words → page range`` conversion. The ``memo-render``
command reads this from ``<thread>/.anvil.json`` as the
``render_gate.words_per_page`` field (see
``anvil/skills/memo/commands/memo-render.md`` step 4 + the SKILL.md
``.anvil.json`` reference).

Validation: a non-numeric override or one ``<= 0`` is silently
discarded and the default (:data:`MEMO_WORDS_PER_PAGE`) is used,
matching :func:`_resolve_target_length`'s graceful-degrade contract
for malformed inputs. The effective wpp is recorded in the
``memo_page_fit`` finding message so a reviewer can see which
calibration the gate used.

The override only affects the **derived** ``target_length.words →
pages`` path. When ``target_length.pages`` is declared directly, no
conversion happens and the override is a no-op. The word-count proxy
in rubric dim 7 (*Scope discipline*) remains authoritative for
length judgments — ``memo_page_fit`` is the advisory second layer.

Graceful degradation
--------------------

The gate degrades cleanly when toolchain pieces are missing:

- ``pdfinfo`` (poppler-utils) absent → page-fit check sets ``pages=None``
  and the gate continues with the other checks. Reasons include a
  remediation line (``brew install poppler`` / ``apt-get install
  poppler-utils``). This mirrors the ``pdftoppm`` pattern in
  ``anvil/lib/render.py``.
- Compile log absent → overfull check sets ``overfull_boxes=[]`` with a
  note in ``reasons``; the other checks still run.
- PDF missing entirely → page-fit and overfull checks skip; placeholder
  scan over the source still runs.

All four checks are **independent**: ``passed=False`` enumerates every
failed gate in ``reasons`` (no short-circuit). This is the same shape as
``marp_lint``.

Public API
----------

- ``gate(pdf_path, ...)`` — run the gate over an already-compiled PDF.
- ``compile_and_gate(tex_path, ...)`` — invoke the LaTeX engine, capture
  the log, then run the gate over the produced PDF. Used by the skills
  whose pipeline doesn't otherwise compile (installation, proposal) and as
  a fallback for the others when called before audit/finalize.
- ``GateResult`` — JSON-serializable result with ``to_json()`` (the issue
  body's ``{gate, pages, page_cap, overfull_boxes, compile, placeholders,
  pass, reasons}`` shape) and ``to_review(version_dir, critic_id)`` (the
  typed ``Review`` consumed by the critics aggregator).
- ``DEFAULT_PLACEHOLDER_PATTERNS`` — the default placeholder regex tuple;
  skills can extend via the ``placeholder_patterns`` arg.

Audit-time backstop pattern (issue #572)
----------------------------------------

The ip-skill audit commands (``ip-uspto-audit``,
``ip-uspto-provisional-audit``) reinvoke ``compile_and_gate(...)`` as a
**backstop** check, writing the result to the audit sibling's
``_gate.json``. The matching finalize commands then read that file at
their pre-finalize gate and refuse to assemble the terminal package
(``<thread>.final/`` / ``<thread>.counsel/``) when any overfull-box
finding is present. This closes the gap a *filed* legal artifact
exposed: a late-revise overfull introduced after the last pre-flight
pass would otherwise reach FILING-READY / COUNSEL-READY unchallenged.
The ip-skill call sites tighten the threshold to
``overfull_threshold_pt=2.0`` (the framework default of 5.0pt is
unchanged for ``installation`` / ``proposal`` / ``datasheet`` / ``pub``
/ ``report``). The sphere-canary regression fixture at
``tests/lib/fixtures/render_gate/overfull_sphere_canary.txt`` (13 hits,
worst 83.6pt) is pinned in
``tests/lib/test_render_gate.py::test_overfull_sphere_canary_shape`` so
threshold drift cannot silently re-open the hole.

    """Run the render gate over a compiled artifact.

    Dispatches by ``kind``:

    - ``kind="latex"`` (default): the four-dimension LaTeX-side gate. The
      historical signature (``pdf_path`` + ``log_path`` + ``source_paths``
      + ``page_cap`` + ``overfull_threshold_pt`` + ``placeholder_patterns``
      + ``pdfinfo_path`` + ``engine`` + ``compile_status`` +
      ``compile_exit_code``) is preserved verbatim.
    - ``kind="memo"``: the seven-dimension memo gate (Epic #158 / Phase 2;
      sixth dimension ``memo_image_dimensions`` added by issue #395;
      seventh dimension ``memo_rhetoric_lint`` added by issue #463).
      Requires ``version_dir``; ``out_pdf`` defaults to
      ``<version_dir>/memo.pdf``. ``target_length`` is the resolved
      ``{"words": [min, max]}`` or ``{"pages": [min, max]}`` dict (per
      ``SKILL.md`` §Length targets). Optional ``words_per_page`` is the
      per-thread override for the words→pages conversion factor (see
      module docstring §"page_cap calibration"); ``None`` uses
      :data:`MEMO_WORDS_PER_PAGE` (400). Malformed overrides
      (non-numeric or ``<= 0``) silently fall back to the default.
      Optional ``image_max_px`` (issue #395) is the per-thread pixel
      ceiling for the advisory ``memo_image_dimensions`` check;
      ``None`` uses :data:`MEMO_IMAGE_MAX_PX` (6000). Malformed
      overrides (non-numeric or ``<= 0``) silently fall back to the
      default — the same coerce-or-fallback contract as
      ``words_per_page``; the effective ceiling is recorded in the
      finding message.
      Optional ``render_engine`` (issue #320) is the per-document
      override resolved from ``BriefDocument.render_engine`` (one of
      ``"weasyprint"``, ``"xelatex"``, ``"wkhtmltopdf"``); when set and
      available on PATH it overrides the auto-priority, otherwise
      falls through gracefully.
      Optional ``latex_header_includes`` (issue #347) is per-document
      free-form LaTeX preamble text resolved from
      ``BriefDocument.latex_header_includes``. Threaded into pandoc's
      ``header-includes`` slot via ``--include-in-header=<tempfile>``
      **only when** the dispatched engine resolves to ``xelatex``;
      silently skipped (with a breadcrumb in ``reasons``) for the
      HTML chain. Enables consumers with table-dense memos to load
      ``xcolor`` / ``tabularx`` / custom environments referenced by
      ``{=latex}`` raw blocks without maintaining a full
      ``template.tex`` override.
      Optional ``render_template`` / ``render_lua_filters`` /
      ``render_metadata`` (issue #391) are the per-document consumer
      pandoc passthrough knobs resolved from the matching
      ``BriefDocument`` fields. ``render_template`` is a consumer-owned
      pandoc template path (BRIEF-relative paths are resolved against
      ``version_dir.parent.parent``, the project root under the
      post-#295/#296 canonical model; absolute paths used as-is) — it
      short-circuits the theme/framework template **iff** its extension
      matches the dispatched engine chain and the file exists; on
      mismatch or missing file the default chain applies with a
      breadcrumb in ``reasons`` (the #347 silent-with-record skip).
      ``render_lua_filters`` (``--lua-filter`` per entry, declaration
      order) and ``render_metadata`` (``-M key=value`` per entry, with
      the literal ``{N}`` token in values expanded to the version
      number parsed from the ``<slug>.{N}`` version-dir name) are
      engine-agnostic and always applied when set. Render provenance is
      surfaced on ``GateResult.engine_used`` / ``template_used``.
      Optional ``rhetoric_rules_path`` (issue #463) is a consumer JSON
      rule file for the advisory ``memo_rhetoric_lint`` dimension
      (check 7), merged over ``rhetoric_lint.DEFAULT_RHETORIC_RULES``;
      malformed input graceful-degrades to a defaults-only run with a
      warning finding naming the parse error. ``None`` (the default)
      runs the framework defaults — defaults-only behavior is
      byte-identical whether or not any consumer declaration exists.
      Wired (issue #468) from the #461 voice contract's
      ``voice.rhetoric_rules`` sub-key: memo-render step 4g calls
      ``anvil.lib.project_brief.resolve_rhetoric_rules`` and forwards
      the resolved path (or the joined declared path when the file is
      missing, so the lint surfaces the broken declaration as a
      warning finding).
      Routes through :func:`_gate_memo` which invokes
      :func:`_render_memo_source` for pandoc + the preferred HTML/PDF
      engine, then runs the memo-specific checks. See module
      docstring for the full check list.

    Parameters (kind="latex")
    -------------------------
    pdf_path:
        Path to the compiled PDF. May or may not exist; a missing PDF
        skips the PDF-dependent checks gracefully.
    log_path:
        Optional path to the LaTeX/engine log file. When ``None`` (or the
        file is missing), the overfull check is skipped with a note in
        ``reasons``.
    source_paths:
        List of source files (``.tex`` / ``.md``) to grep for placeholders.
        When ``None`` or empty, the placeholder check is skipped.
    page_cap:
        Hard cap on page count. ``None`` (the common case) skips the
        page-fit check — the actual page count is still recorded in
        ``GateResult.pages`` for informational purposes.
    overfull_threshold_pt:
        Overfull-box tolerance in points. Boxes with amount strictly
        greater than this threshold fail. Default ``5.0``.
    placeholder_patterns:
        Tuple of regex patterns. When ``None``, uses
        ``DEFAULT_PLACEHOLDER_PATTERNS``. When the caller wants to
        *extend* the defaults (e.g. ip-uspto's ``\\refnum{??}``), pass
        ``DEFAULT_PLACEHOLDER_PATTERNS + ("...",)``.
    pdfinfo_path:
        Override for the ``pdfinfo`` executable path (testability).
    engine:
        Optional engine label echoed into reasons (e.g., ``"pandoc"``).
        When ``engine == "pandoc"`` the overfull-box check is skipped
        with a documented note (pandoc has no ``Overfull`` semantics).
    compile_status, compile_exit_code:
        Caller-supplied compile outcome. When the caller has already
        compiled (or this is a pre-built PDF), pass these to populate the
        ``compile`` JSON block. When both are ``None`` the gate assumes
        ``COMPILE_SKIPPED`` (the PDF was prepared elsewhere).

    All four checks run independently — no short-circuit. ``passed``
    reflects the AND of the gates that did NOT skip.

def _select_memo_engine(requested: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[str]:
    """Return the preferred memo HTML/PDF engine that is available on PATH.

    Default priority per architect Q1 (Epic #158): ``weasyprint`` >
    ``wkhtmltopdf`` > ``xelatex``. Returns ``None`` when none are
    available — callers surface ``MEMO_RENDERER_REMEDIATION`` in that
    case.

    When ``requested`` is one of the recognized engine names AND that
    engine is available on PATH, it wins over the default priority
    order. When the requested engine is NOT available, the function
    falls through to the default order rather than returning ``None``
    — the "respect the brand pin if you can, but render something
    rather than nothing" contract that matches the broader anvil
    graceful-degrade discipline. The caller can detect a mismatch by
    comparing the returned engine to ``requested``.

    The ``requested`` knob is the integration point for two related
    features:

    - The per-theme ``render_engine`` default from
      ``<consumer>/.anvil/themes/<theme>/theme.yml`` (issue #322).
    - The per-document ``documents[].render_engine`` override from
      the project BRIEF (issue #320).

    Per-document > per-theme > framework default. The caller in
    :func:`_render_memo_source` is responsible for resolving the
    precedence and passing the winning value as ``requested``.

    The optional ``requested`` parameter (issue #320) carries the
    per-document override from ``BriefDocument.render_engine`` (one of
    ``"weasyprint"``, ``"xelatex"``, ``"wkhtmltopdf"``). When set AND the
    requested engine is available on PATH, this function returns the
    requested engine regardless of the default priority order. When the
    requested engine is set but NOT available on PATH, the function
    **gracefully falls through** to the existing auto-priority — it does
    NOT raise (consistent with the graceful-degrade contract called out
    in architect Q7). When ``requested`` is ``None``, behavior is
    identical to the pre-#320 contract: no regression on legacy callers.

    Indirected through :mod:`anvil.lib.render` so monkeypatched
    ``check_*_available`` functions in tests take effect uniformly.

    HTML-to-PDF leg prefers weasyprint, falls back to wkhtmltopdf, falls
    back to xelatex as the engine-of-last-resort.

    Parameters
    ----------
    version_dir:
        ``<thread>.{N}/`` directory containing ``<thread>.md`` (body
        filename echoes the thread slug per #295).
    out_pdf:
        Output PDF path. Parent directory must exist.
    requested_engine:
        Optional per-document engine override (issue #320). Composed
        with the per-theme ``render_engine`` default from issue #322
        as ``effective_engine = requested_engine or theme_engine``;
        the result is threaded through to :func:`_select_memo_engine`.
        Per-thread wins by short-circuit: when ``requested_engine`` is
        truthy it is used directly; when ``None`` the per-theme default
        from ``theme.yml`` (discovered via
        :func:`_discover_memo_theme_context`) takes over; when both are
        absent, :func:`_select_memo_engine` falls through to the
        framework auto-priority (weasyprint > wkhtmltopdf > xelatex).
        When set and available on PATH, the effective engine is used;
        otherwise auto-priority applies.
    latex_header_includes:
        Optional per-document free-form LaTeX preamble text (issue
        #347). When set AND the dispatched engine resolves to
        ``xelatex``, the content is written to a tempfile and passed
        to pandoc via ``--include-in-header=<tempfile>``; pandoc
        emits the content into the xelatex template's
        ``$for(header-includes)$`` slot. The tempfile is removed
        before this function returns (whether the subprocess
        succeeded or failed). When the engine is NOT xelatex, the
        include is silently skipped (caller is expected to record
        the skip in the audit trail) — this matches the
        engine-scoping policy that ``latex_header_includes`` is for
        LaTeX content only and the HTML chain has no analogue.
    render_template:
        Optional per-document consumer-owned pandoc template path
        (issue #391). Relative paths are resolved against
        ``version_dir.parent.parent`` (the project root — the
        directory containing ``BRIEF.md`` under the post-#295/#296
        canonical ``<project>/<slug>/<slug>.{N}/`` model); absolute
        paths are used as-is. Applied as ``--template <path>``
        *instead of* the theme/framework template **iff** the file
        exists AND its extension matches the dispatched chain
        (``.tex`` / ``.latex`` on xelatex; ``.html`` / ``.htm`` on
        weasyprint / wkhtmltopdf). On mismatch or missing file the
        existing resolver chain applies and a skip breadcrumb is
        recorded in ``provenance["skips"]`` (the caller surfaces it
        in ``reasons``). The HTML chain's ``--css`` flag is NOT
        suppressed by a consumer template — a self-contained
        template simply ignores it.
    render_lua_filters:
        Optional list of pandoc Lua filter paths (issue #391),
        resolved like ``render_template``. Engine-agnostic: each
        existing filter is passed as ``--lua-filter <path>`` in
        declaration order on every chain; a missing filter file is
        skipped with a ``provenance["skips"]`` breadcrumb (remaining
        filters still apply).
    render_metadata:
        Optional map of pandoc metadata entries (issue #391). Each
        ``key: value`` pair is passed as ``-M key=value``.
        Engine-agnostic. The literal token ``{N}`` in a *value* is
        expanded to the version number parsed from the
        ``<slug>.{N}`` version-dir name (e.g., ``Draft v{N}`` →
        ``Draft v7`` for ``<slug>.7/``); when the dir name carries
        no version suffix the value passes through verbatim.
    provenance:
        Optional caller-owned dict the function fills with render
        provenance (issue #391): ``provenance["template"]`` is the
        template provenance string (resolved consumer path,
        ``"theme:<name>"``, ``"framework-default"``, or
        ``"pandoc-default"`` when no ``--template`` flag was passed)
        and ``provenance["skips"]`` is a list of breadcrumb strings
        for skipped consumer inputs. Untouched when no engine ran
        (pandoc/engines unavailable, missing body markdown).

    Returns
    -------
    A 4-tuple of ``(compile_status, exit_code, engine_used, stderr)``:

    - ``compile_status``: one of :data:`COMPILE_OK`,
      :data:`COMPILE_FAILED`, :data:`COMPILE_UNAVAILABLE`,
      :data:`COMPILE_SKIPPED`.
    - ``exit_code``: subprocess exit code, or ``-1`` when the engine
      raised before producing one.
    - ``engine_used``: the engine name (``"weasyprint"``,
      ``"wkhtmltopdf"``, ``"xelatex"``, or ``""`` when no engine ran).
    - ``stderr``: captured stderr text from the pandoc invocation
      (used by the overfull-check pass; empty when nothing ran).

    Does NOT raise on engine absence. Returns
    ``(COMPILE_UNAVAILABLE, -1, "", "")`` instead so the caller can
    surface :data:`MEMO_RENDERER_REMEDIATION` without an exception
    handler. This matches the graceful-degrade contract called out in
    architect Q7 (Epic #158).

      directly. ``source`` is ``"pages"`` so the gate fires errors
      (vs warnings) per architect Q3. The ``words_per_page`` override
      is a **no-op** on this path (no conversion happens).
    - ``None`` or malformed — returns ``(None, None, "none", <wpp>)``;
      the page-fit check is skipped.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_length:
        The resolved-target dict from ``_progress.json`` or ``None``.
    words_per_page:
        Optional per-thread override for the words→pages conversion
        factor. ``None`` (the default) uses :data:`MEMO_WORDS_PER_PAGE`.
        Already validated by :func:`_coerce_words_per_page` (the public
        ``gate`` entry coerces before passing through).

    Returns
    -------
    A 4-tuple:

    - ``page_range``: ``(min_pages, max_pages)`` or ``None``.
    - ``word_range``: ``(min_words, max_words)`` or ``None`` (only set
      when ``words`` is the declared shape).
    - ``source``: one of ``"pages"``, ``"words"``, ``"none"``.
    - ``effective_wpp``: the wpp value used for the conversion (the
      override when set, otherwise :data:`MEMO_WORDS_PER_PAGE`). Always
      returned (even when the conversion didn't happen) so the caller
      can surface it in the finding message.

    The function is structured to mirror the LaTeX gate's "all checks run
    independently, no short-circuit" contract.

    The optional ``render_engine`` parameter (issue #320) carries the
    per-document override forwarded from
    ``BriefDocument.render_engine`` via the public :func:`gate`
    dispatcher. It is plumbed verbatim to
    :func:`_render_memo_source`; the actual honor-or-fallthrough
    decision lives in :func:`_select_memo_engine`. When ``None``, the
    auto-priority order applies (no regression on legacy callers).

    The optional ``image_max_px`` parameter (issue #395) is the
    per-thread pixel ceiling for the advisory ``memo_image_dimensions``
    check (check 5). Coerced via :func:`_coerce_image_max_px` (the
    ``words_per_page`` coerce-or-silently-fallback pattern); ``None``
    or a malformed value uses :data:`MEMO_IMAGE_MAX_PX` (6000), and
    the effective ceiling is recorded in the finding/reason message.

    The optional ``latex_header_includes`` parameter (issue #347)
    carries per-document free-form LaTeX preamble text forwarded from
    ``BriefDocument.latex_header_includes``. Plumbed verbatim to
    :func:`_render_memo_source`, which threads it into pandoc's
    ``header-includes`` slot via ``--include-in-header=<tempfile>``
    **only when** the dispatched engine resolves to ``xelatex``.
    Silent-with-record skip when the engine is HTML-side: the skip is
    appended to ``reasons`` for the audit trail without flipping any
    gate status. When ``None``, no include is added (no regression on
    legacy callers).

    The optional ``render_template`` / ``render_lua_filters`` /
    ``render_metadata`` parameters (issue #391) carry the per-document
    consumer pandoc passthrough knobs forwarded from the matching
    ``BriefDocument`` fields. Plumbed verbatim to
    :func:`_render_memo_source` (see its docstring for the resolution,
    extension-matching, and ``{N}``-expansion semantics). Skip
    breadcrumbs the renderer records (template extension/engine
    mismatch, missing template or filter file) are appended to
    ``reasons`` — silent-with-record, never a gate failure on their
    own. Render provenance lands on ``GateResult.engine_used`` /
    ``template_used`` so memo-render can persist
    ``_progress.json.phases.render.engine`` / ``.template``.

    The optional ``rhetoric_rules_path`` parameter (issue #463) is a
    consumer JSON rule file for the advisory ``memo_rhetoric_lint``
    dimension (check 7), forwarded verbatim to
    :func:`anvil.lib.rhetoric_lint.lint_rhetoric` as
    ``extra_rules_path``. ``None`` runs the framework defaults. The
    BRIEF-side carrier is ``voice.rhetoric_rules``, resolved by
    ``anvil.lib.project_brief.resolve_rhetoric_rules`` (issue #468).

    """Compile ``tex_path`` with ``engine``, capture the log, then run the
    gate over the produced PDF.

    Used by skills whose pipeline doesn't otherwise compile (installation,
    proposal) and as a fallback for the others when the gate runs before
    audit/finalize. The compile is **single-pass** by default — enough to
    catch syntax errors and overfull boxes. Skills that need a full
    multi-pass compile (e.g., ``pub`` needs ``pdflatex && bibtex &&
    pdflatex && pdflatex`` for citations) should run that compile in their
    audit step and then call ``gate(...)`` against the produced PDF +
    log; this helper is the "first pass / no upstream compile" path.

    On engine-not-on-PATH, returns a ``GateResult`` with
    ``compile_status="unavailable"`` (the page-fit / overfull /
    placeholder checks then run against any pre-existing PDF + log if
    they happen to exist, or skip gracefully).

    Parameters
    ----------
    tex_path:
        Source ``.tex`` to compile.
    engine:
        ``"xelatex"`` (default) / ``"pdflatex"`` / ``"pandoc"``. When
        ``"pandoc"`` the overfull-box check is skipped (no semantics).
    page_cap, overfull_threshold_pt, placeholder_patterns, pdfinfo_path:
        Passed through to ``gate``.
    extra_source_paths:
        Additional source files to scan for placeholders (in addition to
        ``tex_path`` itself). Useful when the artifact has a multi-file
        source (e.g., ``main.tex`` + included chapter files).
    output_dir:
        Directory the engine should write output to. Defaults to
        ``tex_path.parent``.

    Returns
    -------
    GateResult
        With ``compile_status``, ``compile_exit_code``, and the four
        gate-check outcomes populated. ``passed=False`` if any gate
        failed; ``True`` otherwise.
