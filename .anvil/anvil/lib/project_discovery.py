"""Project-as-thread-root discovery for the memo skill (issue #284, #295).

Sub-deliverable 1 of #283 — the **foundational** discovery primitive that
later sub-deliverables (BRIEF parser #285, rubric overlay selection #286,
cross-thread ref validation #287) depend on knowing where to look.

Simplification under issue #295
-------------------------------
Originally (PR #290) this module shipped **dual-layout** discovery,
recognizing both a "classic siblings-under-portfolio" layout and a
"project-as-thread-root" layout. Issue #295 retires the classic layout:
every memo thread now lives inside a project root with a project-level
``BRIEF.md``. The ``LAYOUT_CLASSIC`` constant, its branch in
``_resolve_layout``, and the layout-precedence reasoning are removed.
The discovery surface shrinks to "find the project root; identify the
thread slug within it".

Background — the canonical layout
---------------------------------
A **project root** carries a project-level ``BRIEF.md`` whose YAML
frontmatter enumerates per-document metadata in a ``documents:`` list.
Each entry names a slug; that slug names a sibling directory that holds
version dirs::

    <project>/
      BRIEF.md                ← single project brief with documents: list
                                 (carries every per-doc and project-level
                                 anvil config knob; issue #296)
      <slug-a>/
        <slug-a>.1/<slug-a>.md
        <slug-a>.2/<slug-a>.md
        ...
      <slug-b>/
        <slug-b>.1/<slug-b>.md
        ...
      research/               ← shared evidence pool (already shipped, #281)
      refs/                   ← shared per-project references (optional)

The body filename inside a version directory **echoes** the slug
(``<slug>.md``) — see SKILL.md §"Artifact contract" for the on-disk
contract documented under issue #295.

See parent issue #283 and #295 for the consolidated model. This module
is **scoped to discovery only**: it identifies the project root and the
thread slug for any path under a project. Full BRIEF schema parsing is
sub-deliverable 2 (#285); rubric overlay selection is sub-deliverable 3
(#286).

Public API
----------

``discover_thread_root(path: Path) -> Optional[DiscoveryResult]``
    Walk upward from ``path`` until the project root and thread slug
    are identified. Returns a typed result with the thread root, the
    project root, and the thread's slug.

``DiscoveryResult`` (dataclass)
    Typed return value. ``project_root`` and ``slug`` are always
    populated for any successful match (the project-brief layout is
    the only recognized shape).

``LAYOUT_PROJECT_BRIEF``
    String constant for the recognized layout. Retained as a sentinel
    so downstream consumers (and the audit trail) dispatch on a
    source-of-truth literal even though there's only one shape.

``BRIEF_FILENAME`` / ``DOCUMENTS_FRONTMATTER_KEY``
    Module constants for the on-disk filename (``"BRIEF.md"``) and the
    YAML frontmatter key (``"documents"``) that gates the project
    layout. Surfaced as constants so the layout contract has a single
    source of truth across this module, its tests, and downstream
    consumers.

``has_project_brief(directory: Path) -> bool``
    Cheap predicate: returns True when ``<directory>/BRIEF.md`` exists
    AND its YAML frontmatter has a non-empty ``documents:`` list.
    Surfaced as a standalone helper so the layout-gate rule (project
    BRIEF must have a non-empty ``documents:`` list) is independently
    testable and reusable.

Algorithm
---------

Given a ``path`` (file or directory; may be a version dir, a thread
root, a project root, or any nested artifact like
``<slug>.1/<slug>.md``):

1. Normalize: start from ``path`` if it's a directory, else from
   ``path.parent``. Resolve to an absolute path to make the walk
   filesystem-stable.
2. Walk upward. At each candidate directory ``D``:

   a. **Version-dir check:** if ``D.name`` matches ``<parent>.<N>`` for
      some integer ``N`` (the version-dir naming convention), the
      thread root is ``D.parent``. The project root is ``D.parent.parent``
      iff it has a project BRIEF listing the slug.
   b. **Thread-root check:** if ``D`` contains any subdirectory matching
      ``<D.name>.<N>`` (i.e., version dirs whose stem matches ``D``'s
      basename), ``D`` is the thread root.
   c. **Project-root check:** if ``D`` has ``BRIEF.md`` with a non-empty
      ``documents:`` list AND the original ``path`` lives inside
      ``D/<slug>/`` for one of the slugs we can recognize from the path
      components, treat ``D/<slug>/`` as the thread root.
3. Stop at the filesystem root. Return ``None`` if no thread root
   identified.

Layout gate
-----------

The project-brief layout matches when the parent of the candidate
thread root has a project BRIEF whose ``documents:`` list names the
thread's slug. A stray subdirectory inside a project (not listed in
``documents:``) returns ``None`` rather than being silently promoted
to a thread — discovery is conservative under configuration drift.

A project BRIEF with an **empty** ``documents:`` list (``documents: []``
or ``documents:`` with no value) does NOT satisfy ``has_project_brief``
— discovery returns ``None`` for any path under such a directory. A
project must enumerate at least one document for any thread under it to
be discoverable.

No new Python deps
------------------

YAML frontmatter parsing uses ``yaml.safe_load`` from ``pyyaml``, which
is already declared as a base ``[project]`` dep in ``pyproject.toml``
(load-bearing for ``anvil/lib/rubric.py``). No new dependency is
introduced.

Skill-local first
-----------------

Lives under ``anvil/skills/memo/lib/`` per the CLAUDE.md "skill-local
first, lib promotion later" pattern and the precedent set by
``refs_resolver.py`` (PR #281) and ``rubric_overrides_suffix.py``
(PR #265). Promotion to ``anvil/lib/`` is queued for the second-consumer
trigger — likely ``anvil:proposal`` (which has its own portfolio shape)
or ``anvil:pub``.

    ----------

        Any path under a thread or project. May be a file (e.g. a memo

    Algorithm
    ---------

    1. Normalize ``path`` to a directory (use ``.parent`` if file).
    2. Walk upward, examining each candidate directory ``D``:

       - If ``D`` is a version dir (``<parent>.<N>``), the thread
         root is ``D.parent``.
       - Else if ``D`` contains version dirs (``<D.name>.<N>``), the
         thread root is ``D``.
       - Else if ``D`` is a project root (has a project BRIEF), and
         the original ``path`` lives inside ``D/<slug>/`` for some
         listed slug, the thread root is ``D/<slug>/``.

    3. Stop at the first match, or at the filesystem root.

    Discovery only returns a match when the candidate thread root's
    parent has a project BRIEF whose ``documents:`` list names the
    thread's slug. Stray subdirectories inside a project (not listed)
    return ``None``.
