"""Deterministic external-artifact verification gate for ``anvil:pub``.

This is the pub-skill analog of ``anvil/lib/render_gate.py``: a cheap,
deterministic pre-scoring gate that runs *before* the expensive LLM content
review. Where the render gate verifies the *rendered paper* (page fit,
overfull boxes, compile success, placeholders) and the numeric-consistency
checker verifies *claim-vs-claim arithmetic within the paper text*, this
gate verifies a paper's claims against an **external artifact** the paper
depends on — a companion code/proof repository, a benchmark harness, a
dataset checksum — by *running it*.

Motivating incident (the tractatus canary, 2026-07-13): a review pass once
ACCEPTed a paper version whose companion Lean 4 proof repository did not
build and whose headline theorem was false — caught only later by actually
running ``lake build`` and diffing statements against proofs. Nothing in
``pub-review`` today runs the external artifact the paper's central claim
rests on; this gate closes that gap.

Skill-local first (``CLAUDE.md`` "wait for the second consumer before
generalizing"): this is a pub-specific need with no second consumer yet.
It reuses the framework ``Review`` / ``CriticalFlag`` / ``Finding`` /
``Score`` / ``Kind.TOOL_EVIDENCE`` types directly (no schema change) and
routes failures through the unmodified ``anvil/lib/critics.py`` aggregator
exactly as the render gate does. Promote to ``anvil/lib/`` only if a second
skill (``installation`` / ``report`` / ``ip-uspto``) wants the same hook.

Declaration contract (fail-open)
--------------------------------

The gate is driven by an optional ``artifact_verify`` field in
``<thread>/.anvil.json`` (documented in ``anvil/skills/pub/SKILL.md``'s
``.anvil.json`` schema table), mirroring the venue-overlay discovery
contract in ``anvil/lib/rubric.py::discover_venue_rubric``::

    {
      "artifact_verify": {
        "commands": ["lake build", "lake exe check_theorems"],
        "cwd": "proof/",
        "timeout_s": 300
      }
    }

- **Absent** (the default for every existing thread): behavior is
  byte-identical to today — no subprocess call, no file written, no
  finding. This is the load-bearing fail-open contract the issue asks
  for. Callers detect this via ``ArtifactVerifyConfig.declared == False``
  and simply skip the gate.
- **Declared but unresolvable** (missing/non-existent ``cwd``, ``cwd`` is
  a file, or a command isn't resolvable): the gate fails **open** with a
  stdout-facing warning (mirroring ``discover_venue_rubric``'s
  "declared but no matching YAML found" warning) and a ``major`` finding
  in the review — a broken declaration is a defect worth surfacing, but
  must not be indistinguishable from "the reviewer never checked". It
  does NOT emit a ``blocker`` / ``CriticalFlag`` and does NOT silently
  pass as "verified".
- **Declared and resolvable**: each command runs via ``subprocess.run``
  with the declared ``cwd`` and ``timeout_s``. A failed command (non-zero
  exit OR timeout) emits a ``CriticalFlag`` (``type`` prefix
  ``artifact_verify_*``) that routes through the existing
  ``compute_verdict`` path and forces ``Verdict.BLOCK`` — no aggregator or
  schema change needed.

Run-all, not short-circuit
--------------------------

All declared commands run even after an earlier one fails (same posture
as the render gate's independent checks) so a reviewer sees every failing
step in one pass, each surfaced as a distinct ``artifact_verify_<n>``
flag. A command that does not run because a *prior command in the same
list* failed does not happen — each command is a separate subprocess and
they all execute; the caller gets the full picture.

Subprocess-only, no new Python dependency (``CLAUDE.md`` "Add Python deps
only when subprocess won't do"). The raw stdout/stderr capture is written
to ``<thread>.{N}.review/_artifact_verify.json`` (mirroring the render
gate's ``_gate.json``) for CI/operator inspection — a conditional output,
NOT in the review's required-files manifest (same treatment as
``_gate.json`` / ``_review.venue.json``).

def verify(config: ArtifactVerifyConfig, *, thread_dir: Path) -> ArtifactVerifyResult:
    """Run the declared ``artifact_verify`` commands over an external artifact.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config:
        The parsed declaration from :func:`discover_artifact_verify`. When
        ``config.declared`` is ``False`` this function is NOT expected to be
        called (the caller skips the gate entirely on the fail-open
        default); if it is called anyway it returns a ``ran=False`` result
        so a mis-wired caller still degrades safely.
    thread_dir:
        The thread root (the directory that owns ``.anvil.json``). The
        declared ``cwd`` is resolved relative to this dir when it is not
        absolute — matching the venue-overlay convention that per-thread
        config paths are thread-relative.

    Resolution / fail-open contract
    -------------------------------

    - ``config.declared == False`` → ``ran=False``, ``passed=False``, no
      commands, no flags.
    - ``cwd`` declared but missing / not a directory → **fail open**:
      ``ran=False``, ``open_reason`` set, no commands run, no blocker (a
      ``major`` finding is surfaced by ``to_review``). Does NOT silently
      pass as verified.
    - otherwise → each command runs via ``subprocess.run`` with the
      resolved ``cwd`` and ``config.timeout_s``. Commands are parsed with
      ``shlex.split`` (POSIX tokenization); an unparseable command string
      or an unlaunchable executable is recorded as ``OUTCOME_UNRESOLVABLE``
      (a ``major`` finding, fail-open) rather than crashing. A non-zero
      exit or timeout is ``OUTCOME_FAIL`` / ``OUTCOME_TIMEOUT`` (a
      ``blocker`` + ``CriticalFlag``). ALL commands run — no short-circuit.
